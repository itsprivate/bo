Once I return home I relax from work for half an hour but then have to do some cooking/cleaning some sports/training - showering - preparing stuff for the next day - laundry - dinner ect. This leaves me around one hour in the evening where I can read before I have to go to sleep. And I dont even watch TV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have even less time in the evening because I have to buy some groceries on the way home, meet with a friend, repair stuff, call friends/family ect &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I hear from some people that they come home - drop everything and read for like 4-5 hours every evening before going to sleep. Like when do you do all the other stuff? I have to do most of the housework mentioned above or my apprtment would be a total mess. I &amp;quot;have to&amp;quot; meet up/keep in touch with family/friends or I would be a total loner. I simply cannot fathom to read for several hours after work because then I would have no time left for anything else and my life would be a total mess.&lt;/p&gt;

The adventures the little prince go on talk about love, bonds, life, and shows “adult” behavior in the eyes of a child. The prince meets adults who do things that are absurd to him. For example: he meets a man who believes he owns the stars yet spends all his time counting them, for the sake of becoming richer so he can “buy more” stars. The prince simply wanders off after asking a few questions, commenting on how strange adults are. I won’t speak much more about the plot because I don’t want to just give my summary, but by the time I had finished the book I was in tears! Few books have moved me to tears the way the little prince has. It’s a very easy read and I cannot suggest it enough, whether you’re 9 or 90 there’s something to find in this book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally appreciate the Nietzsches dislike for everything religious and I think it was his topic to get rid of the religious nonsense that existed back then (and still exists). I only read Antichrist so far, which is a full rant about religions where every religion is kind of rated and the nonsense exposed (except Buddhism, Buddhism is fine according to Nietzsche).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being this explicit against religions is astonishing, especially so since his books where written in the mid 19th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the polemic, direct, cynical, provoking and sometimes funny style of Nietzsche. He wrote what he was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read it in the original german, and there where a lot more h letters in the german language back then. But this is not what made it hard to read. The philosophy is not direct in the book, but transmitted through some bible style text that you somewhat have to interpret yourself. I had to read most sentences twice to get any meaning out of it. But sometimes also that failed and I couldn&amp;#39;t extract any meaning for me and I continued. I think this book has to be read multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I is famous for the &amp;#39;Übermensch&amp;#39; and the &amp;#39;Wille zu Macht&amp;#39;. The Übermensch is all over this book. The Will zur Macht is at best scratched and not really explained. I&amp;#39;m wondering actually why it is famous for that. I think he explained this concept in later books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;Übermensch&amp;#39; is a dangerous thought imho. Especially since he speaks of superfluous people that he hopes will die soon! Tough and unthinkable to write something like this by today standards. No wonder the Nazis liked this. I get there are lost people and people that seem to have no purpose at all, but questioning there right to live doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I get from the Übermensch is that humankind should work on improving themselves (morally). To be better tomorrow than we are today (and there is a lot of room for improvement there to be honest). He also wrote that you cannot become the Übermensch, but your best chance is to &amp;#39;bear&amp;#39; the Übermensch. Meaning for me that we should teach our children too not make the racist, homophobic and whatnot mistakes we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes and thoughts I took from parts of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tausend Ziele gab es bisher, denn tausend Völker gabe es. Nur die Fessel der tausend Nacken fehlt noch, es fehlt das Eine Ziel. Noch hat die Menschheit kein Ziel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aber sagt mir doch, meine Brüder: wenn der Menschheit das Ziel noch fehlt, fehlt da nicht auch - sie selber noch? -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the original german, I&amp;#39;m unable to translate Nietzsche to proper english. But the summary is that humankind has no goal and therefore lacks humanity. This is very strong and made me think a lot. I agree that we have no goal at all. We are just exploiting each other without any goal, so that a small fraction of people become rich and live very well while the others live in poverty and bad situations. This is inhumane. But on the other hand, what would be the goal for humanity? Improve the situation for everybody and not for a fraction of people, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also one really great sentence about freedom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Frei wovon? Was schiert das Zarathustra! Hell aber soll mir dein Auge künden: frei wozu?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom for what? What do you do with your freedom? A good question that you better answer before you fight for freedom. It is easy to see something that is hindering your freedom. But what do you do if you get rid of it (if only hypothetical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about praise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Und auch das lernte ich unter ihnen: der Lobende stellt sich, als gäbe er zurück, in Wahrheit aber will er mehr beschenkt sein&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praise is always egoistic and &amp;#39;hierarchic&amp;#39; and you have to be careful with that. Read a whole book about his once. Praise _always_ &amp;#39;belittles&amp;#39; the praised one (more or less, depending on the context).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems to be also obsessed with the &amp;#39;Schaffen&amp;#39; (to work or produce something) concept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wollen befreit: denn Wollen is Schaffen: so lehre ich. Und &lt;em&gt;nur&lt;/em&gt; zum Schaffen sollt ihr lernen&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only learn something if you want to produce something with it. Whats the purpose of learning something If you don&amp;#39;t use it to produce something? Not sure about this. I you enjoy learning something without any purpose for pure egoist hedonism it still can be worthwhile imho. But it improves only yourself and is a dead end for improving humankind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something about the Wille zur Macht at last?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Euer Werk, euer Wille is euer »Nächster«: lasst euch keine falschen Werthe einreden!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful if others want to put there values upon you (which religions tend t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;). Trust on your own egoistic willpower, it is your best &amp;#39;neighbour&amp;#39;. I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I really laughed at the cynicism of Nietzsche at the end of the book. Since God is Dead and there is nobody to worship anymore they start worshiping the donkey in the room. Man, this was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you could write whole books about the interpretation of this book (and there are already whole books about this book) this are my main points I took out of it. I&amp;#39;m glad I read it, if only for the new thoughts mentioned above it sparked.&lt;/p&gt;

His earlier trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Ambergris&lt;/em&gt;, is obscure enough that it was mostly out of print until a year ago when it was released in as an omnibus. After reading through the trilogy in a couple weeks, I am convinced it&amp;#39;s small following is due to a lack of marketing and readers constantly misunderstanding what they&amp;#39;re getting into when they come to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vandermeer employs strange literary devices to describe the interactions of the civilians of the vivid, strange city of Ambergris. At the core, Vandermeer is writing pure literary works here. Stylistically he reads far more like McCarthy, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway than the typical fantasy fiction juggernauts. Content-wise, his stories are streamlined on characters, just like any literary work. The fantasy elements are included in deeply human ways that force the reader to grapple with the fate of millions and what it means to witness and understand history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books are sadly impossible to market. His later work found critical success with &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;, which could be pigeonholed as a thriller for marketing. &lt;em&gt;Ambergris&lt;/em&gt; still sits in the background, mostly unread and avoided, which a real shame. You can classify it as weird fiction but that label will send away most of the readers who will truly love it, as you don&amp;#39;t really expect to see a mushroom-world in literary canon.  I&amp;#39;m fairly well-read and I was constantly amazed as Vandermeer showed me time and again things I never imagined in a book. His later work is more polished and marketable but this early trilogy arguably has more heart in it.

&lt;p&gt;Like most of us, I used to devour books when I was a child. There was no way of stopping me from reading anything I could find on my mom&amp;#39;s bookshelf. But adult life has gotten the better of me; I have to study a lot to keep up with office work, and I just didn&amp;#39;t have the energy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as of late, I have re-kindled the momentum of reading books that I like and find quite enjoyable, both fiction as well as technical stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, there are 2x100 page books/short stories in there, which feels like cheating. But I don&amp;#39;t mind, as long as you don&amp;#39;t! I&amp;#39;ve overcome the laziness and I&amp;#39;ve been back at reading for a while. And I&amp;#39;m proud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started because I wanted to finish the Dante and Colombia series by Sandrone Dazieri, so I re-read the second book in order to get into the third. And I just couldn&amp;#39;t stop. The first book is called Kill the Father, if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also threw a few science books in there that I knew I&amp;#39;d love, for good measure (had them collecting dust on my shelves):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill the Angel (Dante and Colombia #2), Sandrone Dazieri.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill the King (Dante and Colombia #3), Sandrone Dazieri.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lord of the Flies, William Golding. Re-read. One of my absolute favourites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck. Read it in one sitting on a 3h plane. I adored it so much!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking. Physics book #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom, Lawrence Krauss. Physics book #2. I had to take notes reading this to keep track of a few things. But I enjoyed myself enormously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Theory of Everything, Stephen Hawking. Physics book #3. To my dismay, I realized upon reading that the conference&amp;#39;s this book is based on, are 95% copied from A Brief History of Time. Since it&amp;#39;s another 100 page read (just like Of Mice and Men), I read it anyways while sitting at a cozy bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Orange Clockwork, Anthony Burguess. I have to admit, that I didn&amp;#39;t know that this book was written in a certain type of lingo the author came up with, the Nadsat speak, if I recall correctly, which I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared for at all. At the start it was very hard to understand, but luckily, the words were very repetitive and it seemed to me that the vocabulary was rather slim, and therefore, it felt easy to remember after a few pages. But I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy it as much as I wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hitchhiker&amp;#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams. I laughed out loud like a maniac while reading this; and I&amp;#39;m going to get the #2, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, tomorrow! I adored reading this so much, I want them all! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily see that I&amp;#39;m playing catch up with my years of having lost interest and practice in reading. There are so many books that I have left behind, and so many things to read from now, that it makes me feel giddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I planning on reading now? I have a few things that I had waiting for me on my shelves, that I just didn&amp;#39;t get around to reading. I&amp;#39;m probably going to read the Harry Potter play first, because it&amp;#39;s easily to digest (I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to loose the momentum!), and I can see The Restaurant at the End of the Universe on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longer read that is waiting for me on my shelves is 11/22/63 by Stephen King!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I feel proud of myself, and I want to keep the momentum going. I know work will be in the way of reading, but I successfully avoided sitting at the computer for a few weeks now, and I feel so comfortable reading with a coffee in hand, that I feel like I could do this forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have you guys been reading of lately? Do you lose or gain interest in books easily? If you&amp;#39;ve ever lost interest in books as an adult, what has brought you back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you all a wonderful weekend!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silence of Girls by Pat Barker and The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller both have the same setting. They both examine Achilles&amp;#39; role in the Trojan war, told by the people whose stories have been often overlooked (albeit SOA starts before Achilles makes it to Troy and The Silence of Girls begins ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read The Song of Achilles first, and found myself sympathizing for Patroclus and Achilles. They were gentle souls who in another universe, would have been soulmates. Patroclus depicts Achilles as headstrong, but caring. Stubborn, but loving. He depicts him as a man with a soul who is destined for greatness that destroys his chances at love. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel Patroclus&amp;#39; admiration for Achilles, and his frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read The Silence of Girls, that perspective changed. Barker describes him as a cruel and apathetic man, who falls much more easily into the role of a conquerer than the story told in The Song of Achilles. Her brutal depiction of sexual violence that occurs in the camps is unflinching, something that is sometimes glossed over in SOA. By the end of the novel, I felt sick even thinking that I had empathized with such a character. When I tried to reread SOA to compare, I found I couldn&amp;#39;t get through it a second time, knowing how well Achilles was described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had a similar experience while reading the two books? Any other thoughts on the varying depictions of Achilles in the two novels? If one thing is for certain, the two completely different perspectives of the same character who has (essentially) the same plot and story in both novels, shows how talented Barker and Miller are at their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

Someone had stated that ‘Steinbeck writes in a way where the words just flow off the page like butter’ and ‘I don’t know what it is about Steinbeck but his writing instantly makes me forget about everything around me.’. These two resonate with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being closer to 40 than I was yesterday, I feel like if I’d read this in my 20’s I’d have thoroughly enjoyed it, but certain themes would have been lost to me. Not that I’d have been confused, the subtleties might literally have not awakened in me the emotions that I’d feel now. Similarly, if I’d have read this in my 50s or 60s, I think I may recognize additional themes that might’ve eluded me upon reading in my 30s. It’s just that this book travels so deeply into a certain time and human condition that there must be enjoyment and enlightenment to be discovered at nearly any age, and each decade may house a secret to be unraveled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of the characters have such profound philosophies, and if feels so natural when they are conversing and questioning the world around them. For an author to conceive these characters, their train of thought, their ideals and motivations…it’s truly a wonder to me how rich in life and real they seem. And for them alone to have you nodding your head, or pondering their words is wonderful. The quotability held within the pages has no end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I only know that I loved this novel. It may be the best I’ve read. But who am I…
If you have this on your list, dear reader, I’m excited for you and the road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s by no means an optimistic or utopian imagining of the near future (in fact, the book opens with &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;a deadly heatwave in India that kills 20+ million people&lt;/span&gt;). Instead, Robinson grapples with every imaginable solution we could (and might have to) leverage in the next 30ish years to try to save our biosphere from total devastation. Pumping water out from under Antarctic glaciers to slow them down, solar radiation management to provide temporary reprieve from warming, direct air carbon capture and sequestration, even shadow government operations to *&lt;strong&gt;ahem\&lt;/strong&gt;* &lt;em&gt;disincentivize&lt;/em&gt; carbon burners from doing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly chapters that slow down into the weeds of, for example, economic policy that was way over my head, but it was still interesting and incomprehensible enough that I felt like I was learning about something new. I still can&amp;#39;t tell you what quantitative easing is, but I know we might need to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever read anything else by KSR, you likely know he&amp;#39;s an open socialist, so you can probably guess what his imagined future wherein we attempt to survive the climate crisis looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re anything like me, constantly looking at the daily environmental news with abject horror as the situation grows worse, &amp;quot;faster than expected&amp;quot;, then I really encourage you to check this out. I&amp;#39;m feeling more hopeful for my future than ever... and isn&amp;#39;t that something science fiction is meant to do?&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m currently in the middle of the third book and I have all the rest of them too. First, no spoiler talk if you&amp;#39;re reading this post but haven&amp;#39;t read the books. The first, &lt;em&gt;A Wizard of Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;, didn&amp;#39;t grab my attention as soon as I started reading it, as I felt like the storytelling was a whole lot of telling and very little showing, but I quickly powered through until I was eventually engrossed in the story. What made it click is when I realised that this book would be really good to read out loud to someone else. On the other hand, the second book, &lt;em&gt;The Tombs of Atuan&lt;/em&gt;, grabbed my attention from the very start and I loved every single page of it. I won&amp;#39;t discuss the third yet because I&amp;#39;m not done reading it, but I really wanted to share my thoughts on the first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on out, there be spoilers, may this be your warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tale of Ged, Sparrowhawk, became interesting only after he summoned the shadow, in my opinion. Before that, it was a lot of setup, but little substance. Still, Ged&amp;#39;s character arc is well realised and he, as a character, grew on me rather fast after the incident. I really like how the conflict in this book rarely goes into combat, and even when it does it&amp;#39;s rather brief and is never the ultimate solution to whatever problem is at hand. I interpreted Ged&amp;#39;s conflict with his own shadow as representing his growth out of his juvenile arrogance, as at first, when faced with the consequences of it, he takes refuge from his shame in excessive humbleness, even giving up on his dreams, ambitions and talents, but ultimately the real solution isn&amp;#39;t to destroy the shadow that embodies his past arrogance, but to embrace it, recognising that it was a part of who he is and learn from the experience going forward. It&amp;#39;s not the most complex thing in the world, but I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the second book is where things get really good. Ged may be a very likeable character, but he&amp;#39;s not particularly complex or nuanced. But Tenar? I think Tenar is a great character, extremely well rounded and full of nuance, a lot of it unspoken, merely shown through her actions. Her tale gripped me from the very start and never let go until the book was over. Not all of her actions are good, but that&amp;#39;s not a bad thing because we get to see the psychological burden that doing those things placed on her. Also, we really get to explore the effect on her mind and feelings of the indoctrination that she got from a very young age by being grown in a literal cult of death. Seeing Ged again is very welcome, but Tenar is the absolute star of the show. The mystery and suspence in this book are top notch. Tenar gets to be a very strong and yet vulnerable character, who is prisoner of her circumstances but eventually breaks free by realising that she can exercise her own agency through compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thumbs up all around, especially considering the landscape of fantasy literature when she wrote these books. I can&amp;#39;t wait to read the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a short, simple allegory that can be read at any level (I read it first in middle school), but that still holds deeper meaning when you understand more about the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure it has to do with the fact it was a criticism of a past event rather than a warning about a possible future like 1984 is. But this is a must-read for any adult, especially in such a controversial political climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George rr martin is a great writer. He also claims he is a slow writer. And I disagree with that. From 1996 to 2000 he published the first 3 books, which are masterpieces. Then 5 years later book 4, then 6 years later book 5, and now book 6....TBD. the trouble happens to be, in my opinion that his writing style of planting seeds and watching them grow hurt him. He kept having branches sprout from the tree trunk of the central story and those branches started growing smaller branches. He should have been cutting off branches, not making new ones after book 3. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like to know where the story is going when I write&amp;quot; I love you George, but sometimes you need to know when you have enough story.

It’s not that I didn’t want to. I’ve been an avid reader since I was a child but since I was 16 or 17 my reading just dramatically dropped off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I tried reading books that were recommended to me. I would often try to read at night before bedtime, I would always be able to get through a page or two before my eyes would start to glaze over and I would get sleepy. I even switched tact to reading in the afternoon but kind of the same thing happened. One problem was obviously I was being recommended more adult books and hadn’t read more than teenage level novels in many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to limit my screen time on my phone about 6 months ago by putting limits and sticking to them. I slowly started to replace that screen time with other activities (not just reading). The effect after about a month of doing that was kind of magical. I don’t know if this is placebo effect but I started to make it through many more pages every day. And once I got caught up in a book I was able to look forward to reading it and it didn’t feel like a forced activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it was a simple as just limiting my screen time and my attention span it whatever recovered enough to allow me to enjoy books again. I also feel much happier fulfilled and creative than I did before. I still use my phone and laptop plenty but reading again has brought a healthy balance back into my life. &lt;/p&gt;

The question was &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;What was your gateway book into the fantasy genre?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer of &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;Mossflower&lt;/em&gt; by Brian Jacques did not take much thought as it is one of the few memories that I can call on from the young age of 11. I did not care much for reading as nothing could hold my interest for very long. My middle school librarian, Mr. Francis, had asked me a few questions regarding my attractions and pointed me into the direction of &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt;. The depiction of good and evil may have been simply laid out in these children&amp;#39;s books, but I believe that they are the foundation for all good fantasy stories. I was at the perfect age and must have been going through the right experiences to have these books take the honorary title of &amp;quot;Gatway Book&amp;quot;. &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; had lead me into some wonderful novels and series such as LOTR, HP, ASOIAF, KKC, and of course many more.&lt;br/&gt;
So thank you Jacques for creating Martin the Warrior to inspire in me stronger senses of perseverance and morality. Thank you also Mr. Francis for enduring the snickers and comments of a pre teen boy, and giving me the gift of reading. May you both rest easy wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question to you is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;What was your gateway book into the fantasy genre?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At the time, the Japanese grew frustrated with the limited amount of space they had in their country for farming and sustaining their growing population. For these and many other economic and political reasons, the Japanese decided to invade and annex part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entering China, the Japanese burned and pillaged many small cities on the East on their way to Nanking located on the west. The Chinese army was not well prepared for this attack and kept getting pushed back. As the Japanese approached Nanking, many Chinese soldiers fled Nanking by boat through a river called the Yangtze just north of Nanking. There were a limited amount of boats and therefore many soldiers were left behind to fight or drowned by trying to swim across. The Chinese army not only left behind many of its men but poor Chinese citizens who could not afford to leave China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Japan took control of Nanking. What follows is the most brutal treatment of human beings that I have ever heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Torture/Killing*\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of the ways that the Japanese tortured and killed Chinese soldiers and citizens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beheading killing contests. The Japanese would have competitions amongst each other on who could behead the most Chinese soldiers in a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayonetting. They used the bayonet (a knife that is attached to the muzzle of a rifle), to stab children, adults, and old individuals. There were some cases were pregnant women were disemboweled by bayonet so that the Japanese could bayonet their fetus. *ALSO* , the Japanese used dead Chinese individuals for bayonetting practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass incineration. A bunch of Chinese captives would be pushed into a pit, lit with gasoline, and burnt alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eaten alive by dogs. They would bury Chinese individuals up to their waist and allow German shepherds to rip them to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One method was to bring many Chinese individuals to the top floor of a building, then set the bottom floors on fire, forcing them to jump off the building to their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people were thrown in the aforementioned river alive (which was frozen because it was December at the time of the invasion), where the Japanese would laugh at them and call it &amp;quot;fishing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of the book talks about how the Japanese had created several rows of prisoners in front of the river where the first row would get beheaded and the individual behind the one who just got beheaded had to push the other into the river. Then, the next individual would step up for their own beheading. This continued like a production line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Rapes*\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of the ways the Japanese brutalized the Chinese sexually (there was an estimated 20,000 - 80,000 women raped during and after the invasion of Nanking)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese would rape girls as young as 8 and as old as 80. They would sometimes do it directly in the street and sometimes in front of the girls&amp;#39; families or husbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would force Chinese fathers to rape their daughters or for sons to rape their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would mutilate women&amp;#39;s breasts by cutting them or they would cut vaginas and shove large stick-like objects into them. There was a really disturbing story about how they would cut open young girls&amp;#39; vaginas in order to be able to penetrate them more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would gang rape many women or they would have them be passed around for many other men in the Japanese military to have a turn. There were stories of women being stored in certain buildings for the sole purpose of being raped multiple times a day by different men. Many of these women committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any woman who would deny a Japanese soldier&amp;#39;s sexual advance was instantly killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disgusting event took the lives of over 300,000 Chinese soldiers/citizens and remains largely unspoken about in the West. This has to do with the economic/political interest the US has had with Japan ever since the cold war. In Japan, the government denies the atrocities to this day and distort history books that are taught to their young children. One of the quotes that really resonated with me in the book is that &amp;quot;to not acknowledge is to kill twice&amp;quot;. Say what you want about Germany, but they owned up to their mistakes and Nazi history is very emphasized in their educational system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was EXTREMELY difficult to get through but really opened my eyes to the human capacity for evil and contextualized modern Japan-China relations. For these reasons, I am glad I have gotten through it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about one of the darkest events in human history (if you read the book, you will find that there is light in spite of the darkness with many different individuals (John Rabe &amp;amp; Robert Wilson of The Nanking Safety Zone) who protected and saved as many as 250,000 Chinese people).&lt;/p&gt;

I have witnessed some of the most real characters, in both their complexity and human predictability, to ever stem from a mind. I almost feel as though I have truly lived a life during my reading; I have experienced so much that has made me ponder, smile with glee, cry with sorrow, and simply feel satisfied with how easily I can understand the various characters (I could relate to each in their own way!), their struggles, and their place in society even though it was written so long ago—Tolstoy was a genius, a genius that could make you question and realize and think and feel more than you would be able to without his mind. None of his characters were without some unique insight into the spirit of the universe, the world, philosphy, psychology, Russian society, or the soul; and because all—at least the main characters—have pulled me alongside such a profound journey, a lasting impression of them on me is undoubtedly imbued inside my core, and will always be there. It’s also the perfect social commentary, and I can say with certainty that I understand the human condition to a greater extent than I ever have. Really, my life has been entrenched with such a new richness during the course of my reading—I cannot help but think that I have already reached my peak!&lt;/p&gt;

I just read a few books every year. 4 years ago I was browsing my local bookstore and no book caught my eye. The bookstore owner asked what my favorite childhood book was and I said that I always loved Harry Potter. He then recommended The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss saying that I will like that book since it&amp;#39;s Harry Potter for adults. (He didn&amp;#39;t mention that the series wasn&amp;#39;t finished yet...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember reading it with so much joy! Every chapter kept getting better and better. It was the first time in my life that a book actually gave me a &amp;#39;wow&amp;#39; moment. I just didn&amp;#39;t know a book could be that beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been awhile since I read a book like that. I&amp;#39;ve read some really good books but nothing spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever got that feeling and what book was it?&lt;/p&gt;
