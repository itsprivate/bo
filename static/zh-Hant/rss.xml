After the completion, it came to my mind that they are strikingly similar, even the non-Langdon ones. So let&amp;#39;s discuss about the striking similarities (keep in mind that there are exceptions) ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death - Someone dies; probably someone important/famous ( Ensei Tankado, Wailee Ming &amp;amp; Norah Mangor, Leonardo Vetra,  Jacques Saunière,  Bertrand Zobrist, Edmond Kirsch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main character is called and is asked to go somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady or the man (in the standalones) - is smart, confident, beautiful, bold and brave. (Sienna Brooks was the only &amp;#39;the lady&amp;#39; who wasn&amp;#39;t exactly with the good guys)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agency - The agency is used by the antagonist to do the bad works ( Delta force, &amp;#39;Illuminati&amp;#39; Opus Dei, The Consortium, &amp;#39;The Palmarian Church&amp;#39;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codes, Art, Riddles, &amp;#39;History&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Facts&amp;#39;, Religion &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story narration is mostly done in two places/paths . The ending involves the joining of these paths. (Idk if guys r understanding what I meant, Eng isn&amp;#39;t my 1st lang)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one person whom you can blindly trust, that is .. until you realise that he/she is the antagonist. ( Commander Trevor Strathmore,  William Pickering, Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sir Leigh Teabing, Sienna Brooks, Winston, the only exception maybe Mal&amp;#39;akh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story has what I call &amp;#39;Hey, we  are/were  related/in a relationship&amp;#39; moment in the end. ( Ensei Tankado-Tokugen Numataka , Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sophie Neveu-Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair &amp;amp; Brother, Peter Solomon-Mal&amp;#39;akh, Bertrand Zobrist-Sienna Brooks, The King of Spain-  Bishop Antonio Valdespino )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intimate scene in the end. (It doesn&amp;#39;t occur in the last three books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character shows hatred to his/her parent. (Rachel Sexton-Senator Sexton, Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Peter Solomon-Mal&amp;#39;akh). This is one of the less prominent similarities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all this I have created a general summary-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character (A) is called and informed of a problem/situation . He/she gets help from someone of the other gender (B) . There are some riddles referring to arcane art or literature. The antagonist uses an agency to carry out the deeds. A gets help from a trusted person (X). There is a lot of riddle solving. A realises that X is the bad guy. X gets caught. A spends some quality time with B. It is revealed that one of prominent character is related to another prominent character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinions on my observations. Personally I find that the books have been becoming worse since &amp;#39;The Lost Symbol&amp;#39;, and have generally lost their originality.&lt;/p&gt;

However I try to do a book track every year to practice and I never got more that 20 books but I finally reached 100 books and the year is still not finished yet. This is a massive achievement and I&amp;#39;m  just so happy about and I thought this was the best place to express it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 100th book was  two can keep a secret by Karen Mcmanus. A modern day YA crime novel  the way she weaves the text from the perspective of her characters and keep you on tenorhooks the whole time. It chapters are all the outlook from the main characters and even though she wraps up her story at the end but somehow leaves something unresolved but not in a fursratrating way, more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended it to anyone who interested in crime or like books similar to Tanya french&lt;/p&gt;

We usually just read a few chapters, not the whole book because that would be too much. Although we did manage to read &amp;quot;Beowulf&amp;quot; in one go during the pandemic. Things I&amp;#39;ve noticed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a book read to me stimulates different parts of my brain than me reading it. I&amp;#39;m able to visualise things easier and vividly, which enhances immersion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s more passive and so less tiring, a bit like Audiobooks. But more engaging because you see the person and their expressions, and they can even &amp;quot;act out&amp;quot; the text. You&amp;#39;re also more inclined to pay attention/stay put than with Audiobooks (no temptation to pause).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s wholesome being in the same fictional world simultaneously with your friends and it&amp;#39;s a fun social activity to bring people together. Kind of like the old times when people gathered together to tell stories. It stirs something inside me reminiscent of my childhood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;#39;s more time-consuming and obviously it&amp;#39;s more like an event rather than being a replacement for solo reading, which I still prefer. Also, when I&amp;#39;m the one doing the reading I struggle to focus on the story for some reason. Overall, I think it&amp;#39;s fun and a nice way to share opinions with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is the first time i am feeling like this with a book and it’s a feeling that i will cherish forever. i do not regret ever reading this book and honestly it’s one of the best things that’s happened in my life. just thought i would share this feeling because it’s a new feeling for me and i just loved this book so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of sci-fi I&amp;#39;ve read till now uses sci-fi elements - spaceships, suits, aliens to tell plot driven or character driven stories. It&amp;#39;s rare to find stories with science and discovery at their center. And even if you can find one, they tend to be quite pessimistic and depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Project Hail Mary&amp;quot; is a perfect ode to science. It paints an optimistic view of the universe- that it&amp;#39;s not a cold and empty void, that humans and their simple ability to overanalyze the universe could save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real life science is hard, it takes years of research and pointless bureaucracy. But most people who pursue science do it for that bit at the end when you finally get the knowledge and understand the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Weir has filtered that tiny bit out, and filled a whole book with it.
You just get a sheer joy from using boring, old physics to do monumental things, like saving the human race. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve watched the movies &amp;quot;Arrival&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Interstellar&amp;quot;, or played the game &amp;quot;Outer Wilds&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

This genuinely perplexes me. I don’t mean this as a critic but why does that matter? Nor am I trying to blanket say that my taste is better but in none of my favourite works of fiction would I say that I identify with the characters (except in a few specific examples, and then only briefly). I do like the character of Odysseus for his cunning and charisma but also acknowledge him to be a blood soaked trickster and not a particularly nice person. Crash by J.G. Ballard is one of my favourite novels but I don’t actually identify with people who are sexually aroused by car accidents. Orlando in Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name is something of a spoilt and neglectful aristocrat entirely focused upon their own wants and whims and yet I love the book.
Why then do others feel they have to like and identify with characters?&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve all heard that liking this novel is a “red flag” and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He’s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it’s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: “that kind of stuff&amp;#39;s happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can&amp;#39;t stand it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn’t this very obviously a trauma response to unspeakable suffering? The novel’s approach to sexual violence doesn’t even begin and end with Holden - it permeates the novel, from Jane to the sex worker Holden meets to the sexual violence/aggression Holden knows his peers enact against other students and girls he knows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really weird “flex” that people think dunking on Holden or readers who identify with him is impressive. Do people realize that CSA survivors, especially boys who are far less likely to speak up about their abuse, may see themselves in Holden? Are they aware that finding Holden annoying for whining or being pretentious or jaded or depressed just perpetuates the idea that the only good victims of abuse are the noble, palatable ones (ie the ones that don’t actually exist outside of movies)? What do y’all think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil.  If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Hellen Keller, &lt;em&gt;The Story of My Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we were all nice to each other, the devil wouldn&amp;#39;t have anything to do and would thus be bored.  Isn&amp;#39;t that just plain &amp;#39;ole boredom?  The way I understood ennui is that it&amp;#39;s a specific type of boredom where there is an abundance of potential things to do but despite that, a feeling of boredom persists.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at a different example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...as Domitian,&lt;br/&gt;
had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking&lt;br/&gt;
round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to&lt;br/&gt;
end his days, and sick with that ennui, that taedium vitae, that&lt;br/&gt;
comes on those to whom life denies nothing  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Oscar Wilde, &lt;em&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is more inline with my understanding of it.  It reads like a specific type of boredom.  Put another way, a prince could wake up in his palace, wander through his collection of exotic animals and sigh with ennui but on the other side of town the pauper boy picks up his stick that he&amp;#39;s played with for the last 721 days and is just... bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any word nerds want to weigh in on this one?   Is ennui just a synonym for boredom or is there more to it?&lt;/p&gt;

I love murder mysteries in particular, but have found that many (if not most) books in the genre are quite poorly written. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations for plot-driven murder mysteries or thrillers that also stand on their own as literature would be much appreciated. I’m looking mostly for semi-recent books and am not a fan of spy novels as a rule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts on some books I’ve read that might help with recommendations. Please note that these are just my opinions and good writing is subjective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - Enjoyed this one with caveats. I wasn’t blown away by the writing and find the way Larssen writes about female characters and sexual assaults grating. That said, I think this would be one of the better picks in the genre if Larssen was able to write women well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The Silent Patient - Found this engaging at points, but thought the writing was sometimes poor and didn’t find the plot plausible. I can suspend my disbelief to a point, but this was just a bit cringe in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Magpie Murders - Decent writing, but characters weren’t well developed or engaging. Loved the creative structure of a book within a book, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Sharp Objects - Found the writing comically bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-2666 - Not really a murder mystery, but is possibly my favorite book of all time and happens to involve a serial killer. I love books like this that are kind of a mindfuck. Please do yourself the favor of reading this! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The Windup Bird Chronicle - A great example of literature that also involves a mystery. I don’t love how Murakami writes women, but he truly is a master of atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

Then they appeared on compact disc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought there was anything wrong with them, or that they weren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;real reading&amp;quot;, I just never got into them. Maybe the selection back then was lacking, so it was mostly popular fiction, which isn&amp;#39;t what I usually read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About five years ago I started working remote location industrial construction jobs and I got a tablet for my 18 hour commute. I got so many magazines from the library that I eventually had to cut my subscriptions in half, I just couldn&amp;#39;t read them all. The same app has audiobooks but I never bothered to check any out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know what eventually motivated me to do it, but this year I finally checked one out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is transformed. Anytime I&amp;#39;m doing something that I used to listen to music for, it&amp;#39;s now audiobooks. If I&amp;#39;m in the kitchen (I live alone), I&amp;#39;ve got an audiobook on. If I go for a walk, I listen to a book. I almost wish I had a commute, so I could listen to more audiobooks. If I could be listening to a book but I&amp;#39;m not, I feel like I&amp;#39;m wasting my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year I&amp;#39;ve read two physical books but I&amp;#39;m closing in on ten audiobooks and I haven&amp;#39;t even been at it all year. It&amp;#39;s all been during time that I&amp;#39;ve been doing other things. I just feel like I&amp;#39;ve doubled productivity for a large portion of my life.

The book is absolutely incredible and genuinely does deserve the recognition it has as one of the greatest books of all time. What really did shock me however, was that once I got over that ~200 page hump, I just couldn&amp;#39;t put it down. I had tried and failed to get that far several times before, but once I got there, it was like I was transferred to an entirely new world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolstoy has a very unique writing style that is very descriptive without being tedious. The way he described people&amp;#39;s appearances and auras, the way he described the dresses of all the women at the balls, the way he described the actions of everyone made everything feel more real than in any book I had ever read before. This is what makes the book the masterpiece it is, but also why the first ~200 pages are such a slog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War &amp;amp; Peace gives you no introduction to the world, the characters, or anything at all. When the book starts, you are just thrown into a dinner party for the Russian elite. The book throws dozens of names at you (many of which don&amp;#39;t actually matter) and it can be extremely overwhelming. However, this was literally the point of that scene. That scene is supposed to feel like you were invited to this party and were just being rapid fire introduced to everyone. You hear out of context arguments, you forget people&amp;#39;s names the moment you are introduced to them, and in general you feel a little like a stranger in this new place. But that is what makes everything feel so real. You meet these new people and overtime you grow to have your own opinions on them. You become emotionally attached to some, you hate others, but this growth is all organic in the same way you would make new friends at a party. As the story progresses, it feels like you are growing with the characters. Every time the perspective changes back to a character, it feels like you are coming to visit your friend and by the end of the book, you feel like you have been through hell and back with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the book ended, I felt emotional because it was like I was saying goodbye to my friends. War &amp;amp; Peace was actually Tolstoy writing a prequel to another book that he never actually ended up finishing, so the characters actually feel like they have so much more of their lives left to live. War &amp;amp; Peace has so many loose plot threads that were clearly supposed to be explored in a sequel, but this just made the book feel so much more real. Those loose threads sort of get discussed in the 1st epilogue, but none of them feel out of place in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know Russian history, you can even make pretty good guesses of what will happen to the characters going forward. Pierre, for example, is clearly going to be a Decembrist, and his wife (who will remain unnamed for spoiler reasons) is clearly going to become one of the wives of the Decembrists who follows him into exile. The story is so well put together and based in reality to the point where you can know the plot of the non-existent sequel just by knowing Russian history.&lt;/p&gt;

My great-grandmother was born and partly raised in France before moving to America with her family in her teenage years. When she became older, reading Les Mis was always on the top of her bucket list as multiple of her friends were reading it and she wanted to read a novel that was based where she once lived. She finally got to it in her elderly years and was making great progress (she was about 400 pages in) when she had a sudden stroke and was rushed to the hospital, where she remained for some time. Once she was well enough to go home and live with a caretaker, I took it upon myself to help her finish what she had started and read Les Miserables to her on the phone whenever she was feeling well enough that day to listen. We finished reading it just yesterday, and I’m so happy that I could help her with a long term goal. She’s one of the strongest women I know and I’m so happy I could bond with her even more this way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins with him trying to end his life, but couldn&amp;#39;t go through with it because of a the halal market owner shooing Archie and his car away from his store. Then quickly meets his future wife, a young Jamaican woman at an end of the world party with no apocalypse to justify it. The story plays a lot with time and history having characters of different ages and backgrounds at different periods in the 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having these two characters interact at very different periods of their lives having been intent on not living the next day was crazy for me to think about. It made me feel vastly better about the period of life I am and that I still have a lot of time to do the things I want to do. I was 21 when I read it (26 now) but I was having a lot of anxiety about falling behind in life. Being stuck in prison in the wake of a traumatic event will do that to you. My life was literally on hold, actually, worse than that. It was set back. I&amp;#39;m still working hard to get to where I want to be in life having been out 4 and a half years at this point. But, that concept in the beginning and throughout the book, makes me feel that I shouldn&amp;#39;t worry about it. Since, why do I have to be a certain age to do or be something? Life is chaotic and our impacts on it are often unforseen. Best not to stress it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the book. It takes a look at the lives of it&amp;#39;s characters that is organic and very recognizable. The way Smith finds some humor in the difficult parts of life and the history that shapes it was very therapeutic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A college prep class, taught by the university, that I took when I was 18 had a speed reading course.  Since then, 13 years have passed, I’ve seen the trend of speed reading skyrocket and have tried multiple times to learn speed reading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, recently I had a realization that I had read an entire book and felt like I only really comprehended half of what I had read.  So I decided to slow down my reading and really enjoy every page instead of treating my reading like a sprint I would treat it more like a marathon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve come to realize is that my reading comprehension goes up when I slow down my reading and read at a pace that’s comfortable for me.  I also feel like I get a lot more enjoyment out of my reading as well as I’m not attempting to rush through it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had this experience?  Is there a reason that this could be the case?  What does the research say?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, some people could be really great speed readers and that could be your preferred style!  That’s ok too.  I just want to remind people that going against trends or against the grain is ok if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

And being forced to read was excruciating. And when I did read, I had a lot of difficulty comprehending what was being read. It would take me forever to finish a book because I would lose attention too frequently and have to reread passages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently going through a traumatic breakup among other major life changes and always told myself that when I have more free time to try reading again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to a new place - alone for the first time in a long time and I had trouble being alone with my thoughts and being terrified (still am but less so) with moments of silence of having my thoughts race around in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I filled that time with reading. And maybe perhaps it’s because I’m still in such a profound emotional and vulnerable state that anything can elicit great mood changes but the past two books I’ve read really resonated me and have sparked some sort of rediscovery that I feel has changed my core personality to be a better person and understanding my self worth and my faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now look forward to reading. I can actually laugh and cry and feel emotion through words! I CAN FINALLY SAY “THE BOOK WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even decided to get rid of my tv and I now spend a lot of my time reading instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a nice bookshelf and I am so excited to start filling it up with books I’ve read, and it serving as a visual aid in all the journeys I’ve gone through these books and the stories I can share with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two books that changed my life:
1. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - was hard to get into at first but I really like the style of writing specifically the authors Prose. 
2. Tuesdays with Morrie. - very uplifting and really made me think my outlook on certain things.&lt;/p&gt;

Holden takes the kid &amp;quot;in his arms against his immense and terrible flesh.&amp;quot; The secret of Blood Meridian is this: it is exactly what it appears to be. There is no mystery. After many readings, I&amp;#39;ve learned that the answers are on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we know about the Judge? He is freakishly huge and immensely strong. We see him crush a man&amp;#39;s skull between his massive hands. We see him lift an immense iron meteorite and throw it 11 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the kid died. He was enveloped utterly by this... thing. And &lt;strong&gt;crushed&lt;/strong&gt;. That was Holden&amp;#39;s will, to consume and envelope this apostate wholly, like the darkness McCarthy is so preoccupied by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Judge took the kid into his flesh, and crushed him entirely. Imagine the scene in those jakes. A body reduced to a mutilated horror of blood and bone, barely human in shape. A pile of gore, brains exploded through the skull, torso crushed and misshapen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The witnesses wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to comprehend what they were seeing. &amp;quot;Oh my god&amp;quot; would be the only appropriate response. One witness asks &amp;quot;what is it?&amp;quot; They cannot be certain that the remains are even human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly believed that the killing was sexual in nature due to Holden&amp;#39;s nakedness. Yet he is frequently naked throughout the novel. It is not inherently sexual. Holden is a child murderer and pederast, but there is no indication that he would rape a grown man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holden&amp;#39;s nakedness is Biblical. &lt;strong&gt;A thing naked is a thing revealed&lt;/strong&gt;. The Judge is unveiled in those jakes, and swallows the kid (now the man) into his flesh, leaving some unrecognizable, bloodied mass of flesh and shattered bone lying on the floor of that outhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

因爲同樣的原因。我明白，其中一個因素是通過一個與自己相似的人物在這個虛構的世界裏生活。
虛構的世界中，通過一個與你思想相似的人物來生活，但是......]]></description><link>https://books.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/books/comments/pcmqvj/why_do_some_people_need_to_relate_to_a_character/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://books.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/books/comments/pcmqvj/why_do_some_people_need_to_relate_to_a_character/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:30:27 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen people criticize books with the excuse that they couldn&amp;#39;t relate to the protagonist. Sometimes ive seen people completely stop midway through a book for that same reason. I get that one element is to live vicariously in this fictional world through a character of similar mind to you, but is that the only way to enjoy a book? Is that the main draw? There are times when ive read books where i cant relate to any of the characters but the characters (whilst completely crazy and the opposite of me) are fascinating. Sometimes the draw for the book isnt necessarily the characters themselves but a more broader picture of how all the different pieces in the plot come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think those who only look for &amp;#39;likeable&amp;#39; characters or characters they can relate to are narrowing their selection and missing out on a lot of great books.&lt;/p&gt;

This seems to be rampant for less popular books and it enrages me to no end. Like, dude, I just read the whole book and came to hear someone else&amp;#39;s thoughts on it. What even motivates people to leave &amp;#39;reviews&amp;#39; like this (for example I just finished &amp;#39;7 years in Tibet&amp;#39; and realized that half the reviews were devoid of all substance and the other half were just &amp;#39;so then this happened in the book&amp;#39;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s my rant. Does anyone have other good sites for book reviews where I won&amp;#39;t simply be bombarded with SparkNotes? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
