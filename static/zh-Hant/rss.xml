Monseigneur is a particularly interesting representation of this decay because he shows how institutions can be corrupted to the point where they no longer serve their intended purpose.  I couldn&amp;#39;t help but think about our media, and how they are so corrupted by ideology that they lost touch with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

Walter Isaacson, the master biographer, brilliantly  shows us the life of a genius, whose interests ranged from planetary motion to as eccentric as &amp;quot;analysis of a woodpecker&amp;#39;s tongue&amp;quot;. You read that right. One cannot help but marvel at the genius of Leonardo and appreciate the calibre of his mind! Had he published his works, he would have deservingly been credited with the discovery of friction, Bernoulli&amp;#39;s laws, Newton&amp;#39;s third law, functioning of the aortic valve and the scientific method. He was centuries ahead of his time and his fascinating notebooks are filled with beautiful drawings of anatomy, which have been explained in a simple manner by Walter Isaacson. Science aside, I don&amp;#39;t think I need to mention his world famous paintings like Mona lisa, the last supper and my favourite, Saint John the Baptist. He was as much as an artist as a scientist and had a intense curiosity about everything in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are  some key ideas I learned from the book which I&amp;#39;m surely going to implement in my own life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1)  Be curious. Be relentlessly curious about everything. It can be as vague as  &amp;quot;inspecting the tongue of a woodpecker&amp;quot; and as serious as understanding the way light from the sun reaches the planets&amp;quot;. Just have a relentless  and a random curiosity about everything life has to offer and be a seeker of knowledge.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  Seek knowledge not to make a profit or boast, but for its own sake. Seek knowledge to appreciate and enjoy life. &amp;quot;Not all knowledge has to be useful. Sometimes it can for pure pleasure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3)   Retain  a child-like sense of wonder. Don a mask of simplicity and like a child, look at the world as a canvas full of colours and scenes to be drawn upon.

4)  Always wonder about why things are the way they are. We may appreciate the blue sky, but we never reflect on why the sky is blue. Leonardo did. And so did Einstein.

5)  Observe! Observe everything and enjoy movement, silence and flow of nature around you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6)  Go down rabbit holes that amaze you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7)  Be fearless about changing your opinions as you gather new insights and let go of your past knowledge if new facts disapprove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8)  Be a perfectionist. Don&amp;#39;t settle for  &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;.  Delay projects if you feel they are not perfect. Leonardo carried Mona Lisa and Adoration of the Magi with him even during his final moments, always ready for a new stroke of the brush. Likewise, Steve jobs made sure the circuit boards of the first Macintosh looked beautiful, even though nobody was going to see them. &amp;quot;Real artists care about the beauty of the parts unseen&amp;quot;.

9) Create not only for others and for profit, but for your personal joy.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Collaborate. One man can never surpass what 100 men can do together. Singular vision may be important, but execution is often best with a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;11) Take notes about things that inspire you

12) Be open to mysteries. Not everything needs sharp lines and well definitions. Had that been the case, the beautiful Sfumato so vivid in Mona Lisa would never exist ( The renowned &amp;quot;seductive&amp;quot; smile of Mona Lisa is accomplished through a Leonardo special technique called Sfumato)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I hope you guys found this valuable. Have a good day:))&lt;/p&gt;

I started to create another account but decided that if anything, being able to see my profile and history of activity could help show that this is genuine and not just some one and done account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm going into a 60-day program, state funded and free (which is amazing), and I‚Äôve a pack list of what I can and can‚Äôt bring. All the hygenics, 7 days of clothes, etc. I‚Äôve got. But the line that hits me is the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line of things to bring are comfort items. ‚ÄúPhotos, books, letters‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt really have any photos or letters, the few I have just make me sad so I figure they‚Äôre best left home. But as audible books have been my escape for so long, I feel like books are one thing that could mean a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we‚Äôll have counseling throughout each weekday (not sure about weekends), and a gym to work out in once a day, but due to covid they‚Äôve suspended any visitation from family, any leaving the site, so for 60 days it‚Äôs just me and the 13 other people in there with me. I plan and hope to make friends, but even with friends there‚Äôs only so much time you can spend before you just want to read a book and escape to another world for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about the library but that‚Äôs a no go as there‚Äôs no way to return them, or even extend the rental from inside as internet and such is non-grata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was wondering if someone had any advice? I imagine there has to be people with books they wouldn‚Äôt care to get rid of, I know when I read Game of Thrones I kept forgetting to bring it to work and I‚Äôd just buy another copy cause I couldn‚Äôt wait my whole shift to read the next chapter. I must‚Äôve ended up with 2-3 copies of each book and probably four copies of the first one. That was years ago though when I was still working as a paramedic and could afford to buy a book just to avoid having to go all day without reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh how times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, recommendations, or thoughts would be truly appreciated. I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm absolutely terrified at the idea of doing this but frankly I‚Äôm out of options and this is my last hope of getting things together.&lt;/p&gt;

I got back into reading just a couple of months ago and I read a lot of fantasy in English (currently reading mistborn). A few days ago, I was interested in seeing if there are any fantasy classics from the Netherlands. So I looked up online, to see if there is some kind of &amp;quot;Dutch Tolkien&amp;quot;. I couldn&amp;#39;t find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a &amp;quot;Dutch Tolkien&amp;quot;. She told me bluntly that I shouldn&amp;#39;t read fantasy and that she doesn&amp;#39;t consider it to be &amp;quot;real literature&amp;quot;. She basically thinks that Tolkien&amp;#39;s books aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;real literature&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That teacher is one of the biggest gatekeepers I know. She keeps rambling about how sad it is that kids don&amp;#39;t read much anymore and then she literally claims that certain genres shouldn&amp;#39;t be read. She&amp;#39;s also one of those people who say that listening to audiobooks doesn&amp;#39;t count as reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;#39;m just gonna keep reading my &amp;quot;not real literature&amp;quot; and my teacher can continue being an ignorant gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

It had gotten to a point where I was reading nearly 100 books a year from many different genres. Once covid started, I realized that I&amp;#39;d never be able to read everything I wanted to, and it sent me into an existential, downward spiral. I was paralyzed, and instead of doing the expected and reading even more, I scrutinized my reading speed and how many pages I needed to get through each day. When I inevitably failed to reach my goals, I was disappointed and began to lose the love of reading I had in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I began to come to terms with this. Stemming from the realization that life itself is finite. It&amp;#39;s funny, I obviously always knew that life is fleeting, but I never fully understood this. After reading some works by ancient stoic philosophers I realized, that quantity is never the answer. A person that reads few books well, is often much wiser than one that reads many books hastily. I&amp;#39;m sure this &amp;quot;profound&amp;quot; realization is trivial for a lot of you, but it has certainly helped me to grapple with the impending sense of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not moving fast enough and that&amp;#39;s a bad thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your time when you read, life and books are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike other intrigue/thriller novels which rely on withholding information and a timely reveal at end, Le Carr√© offers a completely different experience. What he provides is a series of expanding revelations, impressive in detail and research, combined with fully developed characters whose motivations are sometimes not even known to themselves. I‚Äôm about 2/3 of the way in and I never want this ride to end.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it is fair to say that few novels have ever stuck around with me the way Blood Meridian has. I know it has its fair share of detractors, it‚Äôs too meandering, too violent, too philosophical, etc. To each their own, I cannot change your mind. Personally, I thought it was a masterpiece and one of the greatest works of experimental fiction that I have ever read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everything which is so powerful about this novel can be summarized in the last paragraph. I had never thought about what my favorite last paragraph was until reading this book. I have probably reread it six times since finishing and cannot help but be drawn back to it. It is one of the most harrowing passages I have ever read and it serves as a fantastic knot for tying together all of the larger themes, ideas, and meanings of the novel. Everything about it is simply perfect. The lyrical repetition in language, the vividness of imagery, the Biblical allusions, and the deeper metaphorical layers of ‚Äúthe dance‚Äù. I found it to be brilliant. The passage is branded into my brain and I know I will go back to reread it many more times. It is a great favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What were your thoughts on this final passage? If it did not resonate with you, which final paragraphs have?&lt;/p&gt;

So, in order to get through them, I would just rush through them resulting in me forgetting everything that I had just read. This was even more evident when I wanted to tell others about what I was currently reading or my thoughts on a particular book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, instead of reading 3-4 books a month, I just read one book every 2-3 weeks. I also forced myself to read slower and be more diligent about taking notes, looking things up, etc. This has made a big difference not only how much I remember, but it has basically made me fall in love with reading all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve been chewing on it for a long time and I really want to know if this happens to anyone else and if anyone has advice on how to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m putting this in books because most of the material I react to is written, but its all fiction, written, animated, real person acting with characters in negative situations. I was an avid reader as a child and fictional worlds and characters of all kinds were my escape from a lot of stuff. My life is much better nowadays and I don&amp;#39;t use it to escape reality now, just for enjoyment but I feel like I was so intensely engaged with fiction when I was young that my brain just can&amp;#39;t help but react as if the people and situations are real, that I&amp;#39;ve conditioned myself to react this way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel dumb even saying this. I know they&amp;#39;re not real. I&amp;#39;m very firmly rooted in reality. But the emotional reaction can be so debilitating it makes me avoid reading/watching something that I know will throw my equilibrium off when I need to focus on studying/working/life in general. I can read something and days later be furious/desperately sad for the character that&amp;#39;s suffering. Often I can&amp;#39;t get past that part, can&amp;#39;t read it at all, end up skipping whole chapters/episodes etc. Some I can&amp;#39;t continue with at all. Just this week I&amp;#39;ve put down a book I was really enjoying because the main character had a bone broken by their boyfriend and their father joked with the guy. Horrible yes, but NOT REAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s especially weird as I&amp;#39;m not prone to over the top displays of emotion in real life. I do have mild, well managed depression and a severe anxiety disorder, but this too is managed by medication and therapy when I need it. It&amp;#39;s probably not helping but I don&amp;#39;t think its majorly influencing my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate this. I love fiction and I hate that this gets in the way of me enjoying it. Please tell me I&amp;#39;m not the only one and what you do to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

Done with the book and done for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire second half I felt like I was holding my breath, until I finally read that last fateful line on the last page (which will remain forever etched in my memory). Once I was finished the only thing I could manage to exhale was an uncontrollable barrage of streaming tears. I even went for a walk afterwards to try to make sense of this‚Ä¶experience but it&amp;#39;s been no use. My mind has been numb all day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to this post. I haven‚Äôt ever written about a book before but I feel that writing this out may help me to fully comprehend it. I&amp;#39;d also love to hear what some of you took away from this masterpiece. I know many people read this book in high school but I wasn‚Äôt as lucky. My English teacher was somewhat discouraging and pretty much killed my love for literature‚Ä¶ so only now am I getting to read these classics, a decade later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most heartbreaking part of the book to me was that throughout his life Charlie was never able to strike a balance between his intellectual and emotional self. For his entire life leading up to the operation, all he wished for was to be smart. After the operation, he acquired the intellect he‚Äôd always wanted but now he found himself emotionally challenged. This process once again reversed itself as his intellect began to deteriorate. He never was able to have both &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can remember two brief moments during which he was somewhat centered: the first during the initial weeks after the operation when he starts falling in love with Alice and still hasn&amp;#39;t come to terms with his genius but this was tainted by his unresolved family issues and confusion about his development. The second was once his intellect began to decline again, when its just him and Alice and he wants to fight to retain his genius, or whatever is left of it at that point. She even tells him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been waiting. You‚Äôre about at my level again‚Äù. Unfortunately, this moment too, is tarnished by his dread of what is to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt that he was never able to find true happiness. And that is what broke me the most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime around the latter half of the book it became obvious to me that it would not end well for Charlie. But I kept wishing. For something, even the slightest of redemption. It arrived for a moment when the bakery owner and his coworkers accepted him back into their lives but that too was short-lived. Ultimately though, I think we all know that this is how it had to end. I‚Äôm glad Keyes decided against a flowery ending - there is nothing about this book that I would change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to end by quoting some passages I thought were particularly poignant: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he confesses his feelings to Alice after the operation but she turns him down - ‚ÄúHow does a person go about learning how to act towards another person‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a remarkable thought on its own but taken into context I thought it was a very profound take on our social nature and the constructs we have built around that nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his argument with Nemur - ‚ÄúIntelligence and education that hasn‚Äôt been tempered by human affection isn‚Äôt worth a damn‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His last time at the university, when talking to Burt - ‚ÄúI passed your floor on the way up and now I‚Äôm passing it on the way down, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be taking this elevator again.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he‚Äôs with Alice in the end - ‚ÄúAnd as I lay here with her I could see how important physical love was, how necessary it was for us to be in each other‚Äôs arms, giving and taking. The universe was exploding, each particle away from the next, hurtling us into dark and lonely space, eventually tearing us away from each other - child out of the womb, friend away from friend, moving from each other, each through his own pathway toward the goal-box of solitary death. But this was the counterweight, the act of binding and holding.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last - ‚Äúplease‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt let me forget how to read and write‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

I found it comical how the novel introduced Frankenstein and his creation in such an odd place and then worked backwards from there. I also found it interesting how the creature was much less of a traditional monster than I had expected.
I would HIGHLY recommend.

&lt;p&gt;I used to read all the time growing up and then kind of stopped during college and a few years into grad school because of limited time or other priorities. For the first half of grad school, I was really anxious and would have trouble falling and staying sleeping too. A couple of years ago (halfway into grad school), I was going on a solo trip and decided to pick a book or two to read while alone on this trip. I picked two thrillers and after this trip, I became addicted to reading more mystery/crime/thriller novels, trying to read at least a little bit each night. Not only does it help me fall asleep but every day I feel a pang of happiness about the fact that I get to return to my exciting book at night and this happiness seems to indirectly affect my general mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think the Kindle (or e-reader) and the library&amp;#39;s overdrive are the greatest inventions ever because I can read about a book a week without ever having to leave my bed. I also very recently started checking out thriller audiobooks (that I read separately from but in parallel with my nighttime book) from my library to listen to at the gym and it makes my workouts so much more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read for pure enjoyment and it made me realize that finding the right genre(s) for each individual person is so important. Some people may find it hard to get through a book and get turned off of reading for a while but I believe they are just reading the wrong type of book and that there is a genre out there they will get sucked into like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I had a brief hiatus from thrillers last year to re-read the entire Harry Potter series and that contributed the same amount of happiness and excitement.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do others have similar experiences and thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

I dreaded reading it, partly out of fear that being someone who is as far removed from the Christian faith as is culturally possible, I wouldn&amp;#39;t connect with some of the theological discussions that I suspected would make up most of the book&amp;#39;s content. In short, I was wary of it being something that seeks to &amp;#39;convert&amp;#39; or persuade the reader towards Christianity. To be clear, I was born and raised in a Hindu community, and now consider myself an agnostic when it comes to the Divine Question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I was very much in the wrong about what the novel is about and what it sets out to achieve, because yes, while it is heavily steeped in Christian imagery and culture (which was inevitable given Fyodor Dostoyevsky&amp;#39;s background), the novel deals with the idea of God and faith in a much more direct, generalized manner, and instead uses the faith merely as a vehicle with which to grapple some seriously troubling existential questions. If you&amp;#39;d permit me, I&amp;#39;d like to start a discussion here about those themes. The two major ideas that the novel seemed to gravitate around were family and faith, and Dostoyevsky intertwined them with each other beautifully, so that the novel essentially asks the question: Is it possible to escape your most base, depraved urges (family), and if yes, then how (faith)? This question is explored in the form of the three titular brothers, and without beating about the bush, I&amp;#39;d like to lay out my thoughts about how the novel accomplishes that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered Alyosha and Smerdyakov to be essentially the antithesis of each other. Both of them had (supposedly) the same father, which meant that both of them were equally susceptible to the Karamazovian tendencies of debauchery, hedonism, and reckless self destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Alyosha was a man of faith, and despite his faith being tested multiple times throughout the novel by various characters as well as circumstances, he always &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt;, consciously, to take the nobler path and bear the suffering that comes with it. One of my favorite bits of the novel is when, after the demise of Father Zosima, his corpse begins to reek terribly, which causes a temporary crisis of faith for his followers. This was an exhilarating turn of events for me, because, as I mentioned, I expected this novel to be very preachy and stern when it came to religion and faith, but I instead found Dostoyevsky willingly putting his characters in circumstances where their belief is challenged by the universe, and the only reason to keep their faith is their choice to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smerdyakov, on the other hand, was a psychopath. He subscribed to Ivan&amp;#39;s philosophy of &amp;quot;everything is permitted&amp;quot; (a philosophy that, ironically, Ivan himself did not fully believe in), and it led to him completely ruining the lives of at least two of his three half-brothers, as well as of course his father. This seemed to be Dostoyevsky straightforwardly telling us that godless/nihilist individuals can and will succumb to their worst impulses. The most interesting character, then, was someone who lay in the middle of this spectrum: Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan was a rational, intelligent scholar who wanted to believe wholeheartedly in faith, but could not bring himself to do so because of all the logical as well as existential inconsistencies that doing so caused him to wrestle with. His qualms with faith are best represented in what are two of the novel&amp;#39;s best chapters: &lt;em&gt;The Grand Inquisitor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Devil&lt;/em&gt;, in which we find the scientific, rational, stripped-down approach of nihilism attacking the more lofty ideas of the Christian faith. Ivan is, however, unable to resolve these issues, causing him to go mad and fall into illness by the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I was pleasantly surprised by how intelligent and thought-provoking the story was, and I think that Dostoyevsky wanted us to realize that reconciling faith with logic is a Herculean task that will only cause us misery, and rejecting faith is a surefire way to become selfish, egotistical and misanthropic. The only way is to willingly choose to have faith, to be compassionate and sympathetic towards your fellow human beings irrespective of what tragedy may befall you. This is a highly subjective interpretation of course, and I&amp;#39;m thrilled to find out what you took away from it. What does this novel mean to you? What are some chapters or characters or moments or lines that resonate deeply with you? I&amp;#39;d love to have a discussion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that I pick apart almost every word of the sentence. And I think it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m mostly detailed oriented and meticulous.  Also, while sometimes getting distracted in the process. Like I&amp;#39;ll be like okay this refers to this thing in this example, this means this, that means that, reread, and oh what&amp;#39;s this thing on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Be forewarned, only 49% of this post is sarcasm and, while I have no intention to offend, I also have no intention not to offend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up Goodreads for no particular reason. Just quietly scrolling and harming no one. I am on leave today and I can do whatever I like, and all I want to do is a little nothing. Tomorrow is public holiday here, so I‚Äôve given myself a really long weekend. I figured I‚Äôd keep things peaceful. I expect that was too much to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a book trending in the Thriller section - &lt;em&gt;The Moonlight Child&lt;/em&gt; by Karen McQuestion. It‚Äôs got a 4.22 rating and that‚Äôs quite high, in my estimation, especially for something that probably isn‚Äôt literary fiction or destined to be a classic. (But who knows? I haven‚Äôt read it, and I could be wildly mistaken.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rating aside, I was intrigued by the synopsis, so I read the reviews. Well. Of course I read the reviews. Reviews are vital. A public good, written (usually) by the best among us. A well-written review is invaluable, but reading through them is a dangerous business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, sometimes reviewers are just parading around as Samaritans when they are much more akin to Satan. They remind us how easy it is for vicious psychopaths to review books on Goodreads. These people are the ones that publish reviews that contain spoilers without including spoiler warnings. There is a special place in hell for them. I truly worry for their friends and family. Villains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now never read &lt;em&gt;The Moonlight Child&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So I&amp;#39;d thought despite terrible shyness to ask you  all for gentle, comforting books of any genre, fiction or nonfiction. My favorite go to books for when I&amp;#39;m feeling raw and vulnerable are:  The History of Love by Nicole Krauss , The Vulnerable Observer by Ruth Behar, and Salt by Nayyirah Waheed. I know this is a pretty vague request, so I hope my go-tos provide some guidance to what I&amp;#39;m looking for. I am open to anything. Apologies and Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

As a kid I&amp;#39;d eat up books faster than my parents could supply them. As a teenager I slowly slipped out of my reading and by late teens I hadn&amp;#39;t picked up a book unless it was mandatory for school. I&amp;#39;m in my early 20s now and rediscovering reading and nothing has helped me more than my library&amp;#39;s ebook app. With most libraries being shut or too far away to get to, ebooks have been such a delight. Especially because I&amp;#39;ve realised I read way quicker if it&amp;#39;s an ebook rather than a physical copy (something about not knowing how many pages I have left makes me more likely to not put it down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently read Deeplight by Francis Hardinge, The Authenticity Project by Clare Pooley, Wink by Rob Harrell, Lie With Me by Phillipe Besson, A Bear Called Paddington by Michael Bond and The House With Chicken Legs by Sophie Anderson, all within the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing how libraries give us so much for free.&lt;/p&gt;

I said reading is a great thing to invest your time in. Someone replied to my comment criticizing it because there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;investment value in reading fiction novels besides the pure enjoyment factor&amp;quot; and that spending time doing something that has no real value can be detrimental.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even understand that point of view. Books are incredibly valuable beyond just enjoyment. Most importantly they have helped my mental health in very meaningful, personal ways during times where I was depressed, anxious or heartbroken. They have made me feel less alone, given me empathy for all types of different people, affected me in a genuine emotional way, given me a new perspective, etc. If people don&amp;#39;t think fiction books have value they have been seriously missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what&amp;#39;s with people knocking things for being fun instead of practical. If someone wants to spend their time reading a book &lt;em&gt;just because&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s enjoyable, that&amp;#39;s still not a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
