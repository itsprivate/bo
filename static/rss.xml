&lt;p&gt;A lot of the focus is on food, of course, so if you&amp;#39;re interested in changes in American cuisine in the 20th century, there&amp;#39;s plenty here to whet your appetite. Pépin has been right in the middle of many of the major culinary developments of the last 75 years or so, from cookbook writing, to nouvelle cuisine, to celebrity chefs, and food on TV. Fascinating stuff all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the guy has also led a fascinating life, and he&amp;#39;s bright and charming. Definitely one of the best autobiographies I&amp;#39;ve ever read, and I can&amp;#39;t recommend it enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago we posted about a project me and a friend were working on, called librimood (librimood.com). It is an AI powered search engine for finding books based on your mood. For example you can search abstract queries like “a book that will make me cry” or “a book with a strong female lead” and get relative results! We got a very positive feedback from the community and we decided to keep working on it and improving it. Since then we have added the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More books&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved search results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiction / Non-fiction filtering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New mode: &lt;strong&gt;Contextual Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;. Get similar themed books for your favorite book. (click on the icon on the left of the search bar. It will switch recommendation mode, indicated by the blue color. You can then search your favorite title and get some recommendations back!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback mechanism . Help us improve the results by scrolling to the bottom of the results page and suggesting books that you would expect to see based on the query that you typed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love for you to try it out and tell us what you think, and where we should focus on next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading this book after receiving a very strong recommendation. Reviews for this book are overwhelmingly positive but I really don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar, Tender is the Flesh is a fictitious novel about a dystopian future where (almost) all animals have been killed, due to a deadly virus they pass to humans, so the government’s solution is to now breed humans for human consumption. This also has the added benefits of solving homelessness and overpopulation since we now just kill and eat all the “undesirables”. Talk about a diplomatic solution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may be asking yourself, without the necessary animals to support our ecosystems, how will anything grow or survive? If humans are eating humans, what are we feeding the humans that are meant to be eaten? If we’re not feeding them human meat, then why can’t we all just eat the same non-human based diets? Why do we even have to eat meat at all? These questions, and more, will not be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It becomes aggravatingly clear in the first few chapters that the author gave little to no thought about the actual biological or ecological impacts this fantasy future would have on the world. Instead the book sweeps the necessary details under the rug and instead chooses to indulge itself in the treatment (i.e. mistreatment) of these humans who only exist to be eaten, purely for shock value. Even this it does not do well. In the moments where the book attempts to shock and disgust its audience, it merely falls flat and flounders under its ridiculous and unbelievable premise. Like a magician with no sleight-of-hand, there’s no mystery here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story at times teases that it might address broader topics like factory farming, animal abuse, human trafficking, misogyny, drug abuse, addiction, homelessness, overpopulation, or any number of other social issues. Instead we get meaningless characters that show up then are never mentioned again followed by atrocious acts with no redeeming value other than to make you feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real shock of this book is how transparent and unlikeable the characters are. I’m not going to spoil anything, despite my recommendation that no one wastes their time reading this book. I will however say that the ending is a real Game of Thrones season 8 slap in the face. If the author thought they were being clever, they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only good thing about this book is that is wasn’t longer. I was glad to find this book at my local library. I would have been mad had I paid for this book. I was curious to find my library only had one copy, but now I’m thinking one was too many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone else who read this book and felt the same way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: in the spirit of fairness, I’d like to add that I do believe the author has obvious story telling talent. It’s evident in the writing. I don’t however feel like this was a worthwhile story.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes I&amp;#39;m looking for something to read, but sometimes I browse for the sake of browsing. It feels strangely good and satisfying. Pulling out books from the shelves, flicking through it, maybe read extracts for a few minutes, especially if I&amp;#39;ve read it before. Touch it, feel it, admire its cover and design if it looks good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I browse a library, a bookstore or a bookcase in someone else house, I do feel like I am intruding upon someone else&amp;#39;s shelves. But the difference is at home, the shelves and the books are mine, built and cultivated by me, composed for my eyes to gaze upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gain some pleasure in doing this whether or not it leads me to picking off a book to read for that day. The search can be as enjoyable as the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure what higher compliment you can pay a novel.&amp;quot; So naturally, I have unbelievably high expectations. And it was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize? Am I missing something?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flipped page after page, cursing, and grumbling, hoping to feel it. Feel what the rest of the world is feeling about this book. I was hoping that this book was going to be a new age The Catcher in the Rye or The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I had no idea how wrong I was going to be proven.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me as I read the first few chapters was how this book was a culmination of age-old cliches stacked on top of each other so meticulously. The girl is rich. The boy is poor. The girl has issues with her father. The boy plays football and also likes reading books. The girl does not wear make-up or care about what anyone thinks. The boy wants to be a writer. It was so uncomfortable to read. Also, the writing style was difficult to get through but that is a personal preference and not a criticism of the book itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every chapter was a mini-story with the same plot with different characters. Marianne and Connell start talking, fight because of reasons that I honestly do not understand, get involved with other people, and part ways. The next chapter brings them together in a different setting with different people. It was so difficult to care for these characters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the author googled a bunch of topics on world&amp;#39;s issues and sprinkled them throughout, forced social issues such as depression, suicide, and mental health into the mix almost like a second thought, and tried really hard to push the readers into believing that these characters are intellectuals with important world views. It was all too convenient to be true. And it did not seem like the story went anywhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am picking my brain to come up with one great thing about this book but I am at a loss. Oh wait, the cover design is beautiful. The fact that the only good thing about this book is a judgment on its cover says a lot in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps I thought it&amp;#39;s somehow inferior, though I can&amp;#39;t trace the origin of that thought. Or maybe it&amp;#39;s too niche - suitable only for &amp;quot;space nerds&amp;quot;. I guess I&amp;#39;ve been too stubborn for my own good. Simply ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of my life I&amp;#39;d been reading classic literature (plus non-fiction), and you rarely can find sci-fi books on those type of lists. Thought classic novels are safe, proven, significant. You can&amp;#39;t go wrong with &amp;#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had a revelation. I&amp;#39;d never say reading is worthless, but my enthusiasm for books was built on crooked foundations. My reasons for reading were juvenile, harmful even. I realized it way too late. I developed aversion for literature which lasted 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I came back. I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;ve grown a bit - and I can enjoy literature with a new set of eyes. I&amp;#39;ve never been a fan of &amp;quot;page-turners&amp;quot;. All I want is to feel, to think, and to enjoy the language. And it looks like sci-fi can provide all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first novel was Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I liked it a lot. It gave me a glimpse of what sci-fi genre can be: well-written, thought-provoking and wildly imaginative. In fact, I ordered over a dozen sci-fi books from different authors. I&amp;#39;m gonna read Childhood&amp;#39;s End by Clarke next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels like a beginning of a new chapter. It&amp;#39;s not a new job, new country or new relationship. It&amp;#39;s just books. But it matters to me, so I felt the need to share. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, life got in the way of my reading habit so the series just sat in my shelf for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this pandemic thing started and I finally got to pick up The Hobbit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really thought I knew what to expect: intense world building here, long-a** history there. But nope. There were sentences that really said &amp;quot;now&amp;#39;s not the time to talk about this&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no one knows what Gollum is&amp;quot; or stuff like that. And the plot was really just a bunch of dwarves, a hobbit, and a wizard going from place to place like Dora (I don&amp;#39;t mean this in an insulting way haha just stating the immediate comparison that came to mind!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I enjoyed it a lot and can&amp;#39;t wait to get into the rest of the series!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve loved the first two books in the series (I actually prefer Ender&amp;#39;s Shadow). I have them on audio book and often go back and listen to them from time to time. I&amp;#39;ve listened to a few of the other books in the series, but none really stood out like those first two. Oh, and I watch the movie sometimes, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So like I said, I was telling my friend (who I haven&amp;#39;t found to be a liar) about my character&amp;#39;s name&amp;#39;s origin and he dropped the aforementioned bomb and ugh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s true. A part of me doesn&amp;#39;t want to look it up. I want to keep a pure image of the books...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character development. The book made me feel like I knew these characters personally. The characters were so incredibly complex people (especially Bunny and Henry) who have their own principles and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession with beauty and aesthetics in the book. The book is filled with lovely quotes and made me fall in love with Ancient Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about this book is its straightforward writing style. It makes it easier to follow the complicated ideologies and rituals mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;

My name is David Ebenbach and the deal with me is that I&amp;#39;m preoccupied with the human condition. Which is to say that I&amp;#39;m the author of eight books of fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. That includes my new novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://tachyonpublications.com/product/how-to-mars/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Mars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Tachyon Publications)*—*my debut in the world of science-fiction. So, as far as writing goes, I&amp;#39;ve been at it for a little while, and, as far as sci-fi goes, I&amp;#39;m new around here. Either way, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to talking! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing &lt;em&gt;How to Mars&lt;/em&gt; in 2015, inspired by news stories about the kind of bonkers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/&quot;&gt;Mars One Project&lt;/a&gt; (like the fictional organization in my novel, their plan was to send a bunch of folks on a one-way mission to the red planet and fund the whole thing via a reality TV show—but my (fake) organization actually did it!), and I was also inspired by that ongoing preoccupation with the human condition of mine. (Kirkus Reviews calls the book &amp;quot;A poignant examination of what it means to be human.&amp;quot; Which is very nice of them. The equally kind folks at Publisher&amp;#39;s Weekly call the novel &amp;quot;funny, fresh, and winsome.&amp;quot;) Crucially, Mars One and my organization both had the same ironclad rule: No sex on Mars. But my novel begins &amp;quot;This is how I find out Jenny is pregnant on Mars,&amp;quot; so you can see how that rule worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the writing, I also teach creative writing and literature at Georgetown University, and live with my family in Washington, DC. You can find out more about me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidebenbach.com/&quot;&gt;davidebenbach.com&lt;/a&gt; or on social media; I&amp;#39;m on Facebook (@DEbenbach), Twitter (@debenbach), and Instagram (@davidebenbach). In the meantime, though, ask me anything here!&lt;/p&gt;

It was a book someone lent me a long time ago in High School but I was reading something else at the time, so I &amp;quot;put it on the list&amp;quot; and forgot about it (dick move, I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;Solaris&amp;quot; by Stanislaw Lem is still my favorite work of science fiction to date, through Asimov&amp;#39;s books I&amp;#39;ve discovered the joy of looking at how some aspects of technology are already far better than what the author thought would be 12.000 years into the Galactic Era (after the colonization of the entire galaxy). In Asimov&amp;#39;s world, there are multiple separate machines and computers for specific tasks, while most of our daily tasks can be done on a single computer that fits in the palm of our hand. Books are stored on &amp;#39;microfilms&amp;#39;, whereas we have PDF-s and e-books nowadays. To put the difference into perspective, back in 1950-70, a &amp;quot;well-read&amp;quot; person&amp;#39;s personal library could take up an entire room, with shelves sagging under the weight of all that paper. In Asimov&amp;#39;s world, that would be about a shoebox&amp;#39;s worth of microfilms. In our modern day, all of that can be stored on a piece of plastic the size of a fingernail called a MicroSD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah... 1940s sci-fi is amazing and I highly recommend reading Asimov&amp;#39;s works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our readers nominate and vote on the books we read, and the winning book for our next read is The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. We are coming to the end of our current reading and will begin The Picture of Dorian Gray on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinned at the top of our subreddit is the Announcement post for the Dorian Gray reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first rule for books that we read is they must be in the public domain and we provide links to free versions from Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, and audiobooks from Librivox. We also have a link to a dramatic reading from Librivox which should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are free to choose whichever medium they want, and read in any language they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our sidebar you’ll find links for our current book, our rules, a link to our discussion archive, and links to our family of subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just hit 1300 subscribers and would love to keep growing. So if reading one chapter of classic literature a day and discussing it with a group of fellow readers interests you, then come check us out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions please let me know, and I wish you all happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

When Ron uses it to get into the Chamber of Secrets in the final book I was more excited than I should have been. That being said I think that it was poorly implemented in the books aside from that.
I&amp;#39;m rewatching the first movie and I got to the scene of Harry in the reptile room at the beginning. I began to think of how strange he must have looked speaking this language to the people around them. Then I realized that he seems to switch between parseltounge and English without conscious thought. This is evident in the dualing scene with Draco in the second book.
This would paint the Dursleys in a slightly more sympathetic light, not by much but at least a little. While I would never treat a child that way I can see how it might be concerning if not out right concerning. Imagine you were at a family function and your adopted son started speaking in tounges, in this case hissing like a black metal singer, and stuff starts exploding. This would be horrifying and written with a different tone and a change of narrator we could have something straight out of a horror movie.
Now imagine you are the Dursleys and your adopted nephew is walking around hissing and blowing shit up with his mind. You hadn&amp;#39;t talked to your relatives for years and now you are in charge of their son. He shows up on your doorstep in the middle of the night one night along with a letter that literally screams at you. This is all before you even know your relative is dead. You raise this child of your estranged relative reluctantly. As he gets older it becomes apparent that when he is upset that your nephew is capable of things that defy explanation of natural law. You have no idea what these powers are capable of or how dangerous to you, or your child, they are.
This all makes the Dursleys dislike of Harry Potter a little more sympathetic, at least to me.
TL;DR: Harry Potter is a Horror Movie from the Dursleys perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

He says this beautiful quote &amp;quot;I dread not being worthy of my suffering&amp;quot;. The book talks about how you should rise above your circumstances and how despite the same one always has spiritual freedom where he can find his solace in. And, I love how he said just proving to be useful does not give meaning to your life and how people these days only like successful,young and happy people. I love how he also said old people shouldn&amp;#39;t be pitied .

While it probably didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of pure literary merit, it was unabashedly geeky, thrilling, fun and entirely deserving of all the accolades and the impact it made on the current sci-fi landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His next novel, Artemis, magnified all the faults of the first while retaining none of the charm. Attempts to write a more complex plot left it a heavy, jumbled mess. The lack of real characters or character development in The Martian was excusable. In Artemis all attempts at it were forced and cringey. The science and long technical explanations went from seamlessly driving the narrative in The Martian to hampering it to the extent where you get actively frustrated by them. In short – nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Hail Mary is, in a sense, a return to the author&amp;#39;s roots. Like in The Martian, the protagonist is a genius and witty scientist caught alone in a bad situation who must use his knowledge to fix things. The stakes are a lot higher. Instead of Mars, this time he is on a spaceship far away from Earth. Instead of saving just himself this time all of humanity is on the line. Oh and he has amnesia, so isn&amp;#39;t able to remember the ship, his mission or even his own name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a saga of exploration, trial and error, mess ups, fixes, near deaths etc. as he inches closer to his goal. It&amp;#39;s The Martian on steroids, and the author makes no excuses for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the author&amp;#39;s faults still stood this time around. I&amp;#39;m putting some of them in spoiler tags to be safe, but they aren&amp;#39;t really spoilers so read them if you&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 500 pages, it is a bit of a slog. There are a lot of repetitive parts and could have been easily edited down another 100 pages at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found it harder to excuse the juvenile writing this time around considering the author is on his &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel. There is so much wrong with pacing, narrative structure, characters, exposition etc. that &amp;quot;yeah, science!&amp;quot; won&amp;#39;t magically fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The science stuff – &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;While the scientific explanations and overall plot in The Martian made some amount of sense, Project Hail Mary makes you take one too many massive leaps of logic. That isn&amp;#39;t a deal breaker for a sci-fi book by any means, but the author&amp;#39;s writing style emphasizes the &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; side while giving you a story which would fit better in The Expanse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protagonist – &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;For both better and worse, the protagonist is Mark Watney 2.0. He is a genius at every possible science, has all the knowledge of the world at the tip of his tongue, is witty, commanding when he needs to be, selfless, empathetic...Oh and he has six pack abs of course. While Mark Watney came off as charming, this one is just..dull.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With sci-fi tastes as varied as they are, it&amp;#39;s hard to predict how the average reader will feel about Project Hail Mary. There are a lot of fun moments, some thrills and a lot of faults. So I will simply say that if you liked The Martian, you will probably like this one as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess it’s a very similar experience to watching a TV show on Netflix — some people can binge whole seasons in one day; I can only sit through like 3, or maximum 4 episodes, per day even if I’m addicted to the show. At that point, mentally I’m pretty fried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those of you who read a lot — at which point do you generally start to feel exhausted by reading? The 1-hour mark? 1.5? 2? 4? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also heard that your reading tolerance is a muscle — that the more you read and build a tolerance to the exhaustion, the less easily you’ll find yourself exhausted (i.e. the muscle will grow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as a kid in Elementary School (with normal sleeping habits), I remember enjoying good books, but being left mentally exhausted after reading for like an hour (which we were forced to record onto a sheet, signed daily by our parents, for daily school homework).&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how it works, but my state (and my tax dollars) pays for it and my local library gives me access to an absolute ton of ebooks for free. I&amp;#39;m sure many of you have similar systems available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I&amp;#39;m done with an ebook, especially one I had on hold, I don&amp;#39;t like to let it expire on it&amp;#39;s own. Now, for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, you can check out a book and keep it for the whole loan period, and when it&amp;#39;s up the book is automatically returned for you - no interaction required. But the neat thing is, the system is able to estimate how long you&amp;#39;ll have to wait to receive that book, based on the standard loan period. So, if three people are waiting in line for one book and the standard loan period is two weeks, it&amp;#39;ll be six weeks before I&amp;#39;ll get to check out the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I have a book to return, I have this little ritual I do where I click into the book&amp;#39;s page and I double check how many people are in line behind me waiting for that book. Then, when I go to my Loans page to return it, I get a little charge out of the fact that someone else, perhaps hundreds of miles away, is getting an email informing them that the book they&amp;#39;ve been waiting for is now available to check out. I imagine their surprise and excitement at being able to read this book a week (or more!) earlier than expected. It&amp;#39;s a little, random act of kindness I can do once every few days that makes me feel a little better about myself, and a little more connected to my community in general and the fans of that book in specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say, if you&amp;#39;re in Wisconsin and you have Brandon Sanderson&amp;#39;s Mistborn series on hold, please return it early when you&amp;#39;re done with it! I have to wait six months for each book!&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve read dozens of other Ludlum novels, it&amp;#39;s like he was on a whole other plane when he was writing the first Bourne book. I still remember being in my college dorm and watching the Matt Damon movie with half a dozen other guys and feeling so disappointed in the movie at the end (when the other 6 were going ga-ga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously other great books out there, and &amp;#39;best&amp;#39; is very subjective, but I have a lot of Alistair Macleans, Fred Forsyth, Tom Clancy (very average imo) and while there have been a couple of books that maybe in the league of Bourne Identity, none have equaled or surpassed it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, peace out fam.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw the film last year, and jumped on the chance to read the book. At first, I was surprised at how closely the two matched. Especially given the track record of Stephen King adaptations, I didn&amp;#39;t expect a near one-to-one in some sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much as I adore the film, the book got deeper under my skin. We see the beauty of little moments and small &amp;quot;miracles&amp;quot; contrasting a bleak setting. This is death row, so maybe anything can seem light when compared to what&amp;#39;s coming next. Still, I found myself laughing and smiling at the descriptions of Mr. Jingles&amp;#39; antics. I had to, otherwise the rest of the book would&amp;#39;ve overwhelmed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senseless and random tragedies of life fill most of the pages. The intense focus on Paul&amp;#39;s experience keeps it manageable, but man, it still hurts. Percy Whetmore is a brilliant character, and I hate him. I loathe him with every fiber of my being, because I recognize him. The description of juvenile malice, the people who can&amp;#39;t laugh at a joke unless it&amp;#39;s mean, made me think of a few real world Percys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it&amp;#39;s a beautiful story. Even if the book-only conclusion is one of the most pensive and melancholic things I&amp;#39;ve read in a while. So many of the events and choices are drenched in a palpable uncertainty. Was this the right thing? Did any of it matter? This was the story I needed right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it&amp;#39;s bluntness, it remains life-affirming. Even something as minor as a mouse doing tricks can be cause for celebration. A companion can make help ease that walk down the Mile. Part of me wants to be mad because I&amp;#39;ll never write anything this good, but hot damn, Stephen King, you made a masterpiece. Thanks for breaking me down and building me back up. I loved every page.&lt;/p&gt;
