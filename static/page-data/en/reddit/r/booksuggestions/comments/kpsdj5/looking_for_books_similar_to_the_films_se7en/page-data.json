I also love the mystery and feelings of unease in all of these movies. I like the elements of the detectives working through potential ideas and suspects and lastly im a big fan of interesting characters such as Detective Rust in True Detective, Detective Summerset in Se7en, Jake Gyllenhall in Zodiac, and all the killers in these movies.
