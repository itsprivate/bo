I&#39;m not saying people with these issues don&#39;t exist, I&#39;m just so TIRED of reading about these girls?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve noticed that these traits are all primarily in heroines in contrast to heroes, like a girl is only &quot;heroine worthy&quot; if they&#39;re quirky and hated by the world. Or they&#39;re only allowed to have mental-healthy issues because literally they&#39;re cursed and whole world is downright comically vile to them on the daily. Where as there are plenty complex and well written heroes out there without a need for these traits to help their likability. Maybe it&#39;s just my luck though, I can&#39;t generalize.</p>\n\n<p>PS. I&#39;ve seen other people who have answered to requests for &quot;NOT not like other girls heroine&quot; to mean heroines who are girly and feminine, but I don&#39;t mind if the heroine is introvert/shy/tomboyish (or all those traits that make up a typical &quot;not like other girls girl&quot;), as long as the author doesn&#39;t continually use this to wax poetry about how the heroine&#39;s not like other girls or &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;special&quot; or &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; purely because they possess these completely average traits seen in plenty other people of all genders.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/pylxko/books_with_heroines_that_are_just_like_other/","title":"Books with heroines that are just like other girls and ACTUALLY realistically normal?
