But it&#39;s a book that teaches that sex and sexuality are natural, enjoyable things; that nonetheless carry with them a weight of respect, responsibility, maturity and knowledge. Yes, it&#39;ll talk quite openly about the sexual act, but also teach people about consent, safety, risk prevention, respect for your partner, self-exploration, to enjoy giving and receiving pleasure, and to accept your sexuality and that of other people. All in a fun and open tone. <em>That&#39;s</em> where it makes the most good, imo. It&#39;d be extremely helpful for some people, given the atrocious levels of sex education most of us receive at home or at school, and for others, it might be life-changing.</p>\n\n<p>I think the book should be required reading for every high-schooler out there, and I have actually gifted it to younger cousins that are near graduation age. If everyone read it, the world would be happier and more responsible with their sexuality, which is a huge part of the human experience, even if we don&#39;t think about it that often.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t recommend reading cover-to-cover in a sprint, like you would a novel. The book is designed to be read in parts, or a few chapters at a time. And it can be read while skipping chapters. Just look at the index and read whatever chapter interests you. Even if you&#39;re not a teenager, and you&#39;ve been having sex for years, I guarantee you&#39;ll learn something new, or get a new perspective about something in the book.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s my epiphany with this book, and why I think it&#39;s important. I&#39;d love to hear comments about it, if someone else has read it.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to know if you have read any other books that, like this one for me, you believe can have a tangible positive effect in the world, when people read it, and why.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/owrqxp/guide_to_getting_it_on_and_books_that_can/","title":"'Guide to Getting It On', and books that can genuinely make the world a better place","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-03T08:38:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-03 08:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"owrqxp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/owrqxp/guide_to_getting_it_on_and_books_that_can/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/owrqxp/guide_to_getting_it_on_and_books_that_can/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"jclinares","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jclinares","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jclinares","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゲットするためのガイド」、純粋に世界を良くすることができる本たち","the_new_excerpt":"この本はすでに何度も紹介されているだろうと思っていましたが\n検索してもあまり出てこないので、ここで紹介します。\n\nポール・ジョアニデス著『ゲット・イット・オンの手引き\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72834.Guide_to_Getting_It_On_?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=whEaHexXdF&rank=1]\nは、私...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"得到它的指南》，以及能够真正使世界变得更美好的书籍","the_new_excerpt":"我想这本书应该已经被提到过很多次了，但是\n搜索没有找到很多结果，所以就来了。\n\n得到它的指南》，作者是保罗-约安尼德。\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72834.Guide_to_Getting_It_On_?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=whEaHexXdF&rank=1]\n是，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"得到它的指南》，以及能夠真正使世界變得更美好的書籍","the_new_excerpt":"我想這本書應該已經被提到過很多次了，但是\n搜索沒有找到很多結果，所以就來了。\n\n得到它的指南》，作者是保羅-約安尼德。\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72834.Guide_to_Getting_It_On_?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=whEaHexXdF&rank=1]\n是，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-owixbn","excerpt":"I was re-reading Giovanni's Room and I marveled at the strength of James\nBaldwin's prose, and how effortlessly beautiful it is, although the book as a\nwhole has a fragile quality.
