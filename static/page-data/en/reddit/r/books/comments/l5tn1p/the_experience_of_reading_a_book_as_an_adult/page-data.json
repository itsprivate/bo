Ender&#39;s Game was <em>that</em> book for me. It was assigned in my sixth grade reading class, and although the first chapter was assigned, I read the whole thing the first weekend. It introduced me to science fiction, but beyond that it completely engrossed me. Looking back, I remember the book being empowering and exciting. To be a child prodigy, to be shot into space to train for warfare, to be a champion in the battle room; all things I wished I could do. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled the book off the shelf for a re-read at age 30, and when I turned the last page I was soul-crushed. As an adult, the book is gut-wrenchingly sad. I&#39;m not Ender anymore, I am a man watching this child from a distance. The isolation he experiences, the sense of duty without purpose, his lack of free will. There are themes that I couldn&#39;t see as a kid because I wanted to be Ender, I was Ender. More importantly, I lacked the maturity or experience to even recognize these themes. I was shocked at how much the book changed for me. Has anyone experienced this with other books?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l5tn1p/the_experience_of_reading_a_book_as_an_adult/","title":"The experience of reading a book as an adult versus as a kid","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T16:12:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 16:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2ad1f40e-0134-5d53-ae47-f889928e8844","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l5tn1p/the_experience_of_reading_a_book_as_an_adult/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l5tn1p/the_experience_of_reading_a_book_as_an_adult/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ohnonotmykarma","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ohnonotmykarma","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ohnonotmykarma","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"成年人与孩童时期的读书经历。","the_new_excerpt":"最近我又拿起了《安德的游戏》。埃德尔的游戏》对我来说就是那本书。它\n是我六年级阅读课上布置的，虽然第一章是\n指定的，我第一个周末就读完了。它让我认识了科学\n小说，但除此之外，它完全吸引了我。寻找...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"成年人與孩童時期的讀書經歷。","the_new_excerpt":"最近我又拿起了《安德的遊戲》。埃德爾的遊戲》對我來說就是那本書。它\n是我六年級閱讀課上佈置的，雖然第一章是\n指定的，我第一個週末就讀完了。它讓我認識了科學\n小說，但除此之外，它完全吸引了我。尋找...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-958ee61f-071a-5395-9769-7390c585e872","excerpt":"Organizing the library in my room at my parent's place, I think I now understand\nbetter why I stopped reading from ages 18 to 26 after being a voracious reader\nbefore that.
