But everyone just screamed &quot;classic&quot; at me when I mentioned the name, so it sat in my mental book queue for a while. Go figure I decide to make it my goal for the year 2021 after the bizarre year that was 2020, super-flu and everything. Anyway...</p>\n\n<p>At 1153 pages, this is the longest book I have ever finished. I figured I&#39;d be able to knock out 100 pages each month, have it finished by the end of the year. Well, I guess things got rolling and plot arcs started spinning faster, and now I&#39;m done with the whole thing twice as fast as I&#39;d planned. I really did enjoy it, especially with the new series coming out recently and being able to watch that with a slight delay to avoid spoilers. (I have several thoughts on the mini-series, but I&#39;ll focus on just the book here.) Bottom line here is: I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t let a bulky book scare me away from reading a thrilling story.</p>\n\n<p>My first impression as I started reading was that King never really does many dramatic moments of horror or the literary equivalent of a jump-scare. His style is more insidious. Instead of spaced out moments that spike the drama, there&#39;s a slow, sneaky build of... discomfort. I&#39;m reading along and feeling just mild unease at what&#39;s unfolding. There&#39;s always something just on the periphery causing worry or tension or something, and not anything popping out and going, &quot;BOO!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It took a while to establish all of the characters and start weaving all of the different threads together, but once it took off, then it was on. I really appreciated the diversity of characters and their struggles. Maybe I will appreciate them even more on my next reading of it. And I really like when they start raising the question: now that we have a chance to start over and do things differently, <em>will we</em>? I think it speaks to our constant NEED to evolve and break old patterns even when they&#39;re &quot;tradition&quot; or familiar or just hegemonic. There were tons of things I enjoyed about this, but these are the things that jumped out first. Oh - and Tom Cullen&#39;s prayer on the way home. That is fuggin&#39; gold, and I burst out laughing at first encounter.</p>\n\n<p>So what now? I feel hungover now. Like I can&#39;t even decide what to pull out of my massive literary queue to read next. How does anything follow THAT? I genuinely don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll probably have to veer toward something totally different to avoid any comparison, a biography or something. But again, I&#39;m very glad I tackled this personal challenge and feel like I&#39;ve joined many others of you that have gone on this same journey. I welcome your thoughts, memories, reflections or anything else related to your own reading of The Stand. Cheers, and thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/o9b0zg/i_just_finished_the_stand_complete_uncut_last/","title":"I just finished The Stand (Complete & Uncut) last night - some initial thoughts.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-28T06:24:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-28 06:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"o9b0zg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o9b0zg/i_just_finished_the_stand_complete_uncut_last/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o9b0zg/i_just_finished_the_stand_complete_uncut_last/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"bruzdnconfuzd","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bruzdnconfuzd","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bruzdnconfuzd","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"昨晩、「The Stand (Complete & Uncut)」を読み終えました。","the_new_excerpt":"The Stand』は数年前から本棚に置いてありましたが、内容をよく覚えていませんでした。\n思い出せませんでした。しかし、私がその名前を口にすると、誰もが「クラシック」と叫んだので\nその名前を口にすると、誰もが「名作」と叫んだので、しばらくの間、私の心の中のブックキューに入っていました。そうだ、20年後の目標にしよう。\n2021年の目標にしようと決めました...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我昨晚刚看完《站立》（完整版和未剪辑版）--一些初步想法。","the_new_excerpt":"我把《站立》放在书架上已经有好几年了，从来没有真正记住它的内容。\n它是关于什么的。但当我提到这个名字时，每个人都对我大喊 \"经典\"。\n所以它在我的脑海中排了一阵子的书。我决定\n把它作为我2021年的目标，因为这一年很奇怪。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我昨晚剛看完《站立》（完整版和未剪輯版）--一些初步想法。","the_new_excerpt":"我把《站立》放在書架上已經有好幾年了，從來沒有真正記住它的內容。\n它是關於什麼的。但當我提到這個名字時，每個人都對我大喊 \"經典\"。\n所以它在我的腦海中排了一陣子的書。我決定\n把它作爲我2021年的目標，因爲這一年很奇怪。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-o8t9fh","excerpt":"So I'm not an avid reader like most here, but I used to be when I was younger.\nRecently I've started trying to get into reading again and it's going\nwonderfully.\n\nOn different sites online you can now order something called \"Blind date with a\nbook\", with most options allowing you to choose a genre…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/o8t9fh/the_blind_assassin_margaret_atwood/","title":"The Blind Assassin - Margaret Atwood","date":"June 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"盲目の暗殺者」マーガレット・アトウッド","the_new_excerpt":"私はここにいる皆さんのように熱心な読書家ではありませんが、若い頃はよく読んでいました。\n最近、再び読書を始めようとしているのですが、これがなかなかうまくいっています。\n素晴らしいですね。\n\nオンラインの様々なサイトでは、「本とのブラインドデート」というものを注文することができます。\n本とのお見合い」というのがありますが、ほとんどの場合、ジャンルを選ぶことができます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"盲目的刺客》--玛格丽特-阿特伍德","the_new_excerpt":"所以我不像这里的大多数人那样热衷于阅读，但我年轻的时候曾经是。\n最近，我开始尝试再次阅读，而且进展很顺利。\n很好。\n\n在网上不同的网站上，你现在可以订购一种叫做 \"与书相约 \"的东西。\n书\"，大多数选项允许你选择一个流派......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"盲目的刺客》--瑪格麗特-阿特伍德","the_new_excerpt":"所以我不像這裏的大多數人那樣熱衷於閱讀，但我年輕的時候曾經是。\n最近，我開始嘗試再次閱讀，而且進展很順利。\n很好。\n\n在網上不同的網站上，你現在可以訂購一種叫做 \"與書相約 \"的東西。\n書\"，大多數選項允許你選擇一個流派......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-o9evwi","excerpt":"God I hate Goodreads.
