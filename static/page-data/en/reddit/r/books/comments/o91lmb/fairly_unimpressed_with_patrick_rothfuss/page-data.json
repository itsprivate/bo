I don&#39;t mind starting a series before its finished to support the author but at this point it basically seems he&#39;s never going to finish it.</p>\n\n<p>However, a bunch of my friends kept telling me it was worth to read even if he doesn&#39;t finish. They said it was in their top 5 fantasy books so I finally caved in and read the first book.  Overall, I really wasn&#39;t impressed.</p>\n\n<p>My biggest gripes were:\n1)  Having Kovthe tell the story. It kinda breaks any suspense of what will happen to him if we already know he&#39;ll turn out basically fine.</p>\n\n<p>2)  The prose itself was pretty good, he definitely has a way with words. But sometimes it almost felt arrogant, like he was trying to show off by his writing\n It took me out of the story sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>3) Probably my biggest problem, Kovthe is just ridiculous. He is like the epitome of &quot;....and then the entire room stood up and clapped for me&quot;. Like that literally happens lol.  He is just the best at everything; youngest wizard ever, all the girls love him, super intelligent, greatest musician, literally talks about how he knows how to size up a horse and a town.  Its so stupid. There are no real challenges in his life. He talks about how &quot;if this were a made up story things would have just worked out great, but they didnt&quot; yet two chapters later he&#39;s figured everything out and everyone clapped.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I could go on, but I&#39;ll stop fow now.  I&#39;ll probably read the second book just to shut my friends up, but overall, definitely not my favorite.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/o91lmb/fairly_unimpressed_with_patrick_rothfuss/","title":"Fairly unimpressed with Patrick Rothfuss","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-27T22:50:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-27 22:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dda59224-651e-5496-8202-5f0a5bc6a168","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o91lmb/fairly_unimpressed_with_patrick_rothfuss/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o91lmb/fairly_unimpressed_with_patrick_rothfuss/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"gardenandchill","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gardenandchill","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"gardenandchill","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Patrick Rothfussの印象はかなり悪いです。","the_new_excerpt":"私はファンタジーの大ファンなのですが、『風の名前をつけよう』を始めるのをかなりためらっていました。\nを始めるのをためらっていました。というのも、彼が本を書くスケジュールが遅いからです。私は\n作者を応援するために、シリーズが終わる前に始めるのは構わないのですが、この時点では\nしかし、この時点では、基本的に彼はこのシリーズを終わらせることができないようだ。\n\nしかし...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对帕特里克-罗斯福斯的印象相当不好","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个幻想小说的忠实读者，但一直在犹豫是否要开始阅读《风的名字》，因为他的写作时间表很慢。\n因为他写书的时间表太慢。我并不介意在一个系列作品完成之前就开始写，以支持作者。\n我不介意在一个系列完成之前开始，以支持作者，但在这一点上，他似乎永远不会完成它。\n但在这一点上，基本上他似乎永远不会完成它。\n\n然而，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對帕特里克-羅斯福斯的印象相當不好","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個幻想小說的忠實讀者，但一直在猶豫是否要開始閱讀《風的名字》，因爲他的寫作時間表很慢。\n因爲他寫書的時間表太慢。我並不介意在一個系列作品完成之前就開始寫，以支持作者。\n我不介意在一個系列完成之前開始，以支持作者，但在這一點上，他似乎永遠不會完成它。\n但在這一點上，基本上他似乎永遠不會完成它。\n\n然而，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2dccb8c3-c59b-53ec-afbe-900d10f5d7d9","excerpt":"This is one book that I've made an attempt to read two or three times previously\nbut I just couldn't do it.
