But they DID just spoil it........</p>\n\n<p>A plot twist is obviously most effective when you aren&#39;t expecting it.  If you know the twist is coming, you are constantly on the lookout for it; you are actively speculating what the twist will be.

I enjoy hearing people talk about a book that they truly enjoyed.  And I (like most people) enjoy an unpredictable plot.  But please keep the &quot;huge twists&quot; to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, the reviews and synopsis on the book cover will probably be sufficient to spoil this.
