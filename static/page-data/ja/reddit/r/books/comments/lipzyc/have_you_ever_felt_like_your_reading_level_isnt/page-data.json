It&#39;s beautifully written, has great characters, and is just a great book so far, but dear lord it makes me feel dumb sometimes. I&#39;ve lost count of how many paragraphs I&#39;ve had to reread just to try and understand what&#39;s happening. Obviously anything worth while is going to be challenging, but I feel like I&#39;m doing the book a disservice by not understanding everything about it. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe this book isn&#39;t tough for the average reader, but for me it&#39;s the most challenging book I&#39;ve read. It&#39;s rewarding, but also disheartening... if that makes sense. I honestly feel like I&#39;m missing a good amount of the story. Maybe I&#39;ll be more confident on a reread?</p>\n\n<p>Long story short... I&#39;m loving the book, but having a tough time with it.
