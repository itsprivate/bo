In gratitude, I took it upon myself to become the “librarian” for the library. Here’s what that meant to me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Take care of the physical resource.  When necessary construction briefly displaced the library box, I made sure it was in a visible, dry place off the ground. I’ve seen some Tiny Free Libraries fall into disrepair to the point where the roofs were badly leaking. We had a brand name, not personally constructed, library, which is made of a plasticy material that did a great job of keeping the hurricanes out, but it still needed to be looked after. </p></li>\n<li><p>Keep books in stock. There’s a Tiny Free Library at the playground our mall that is absolutely empty 99% of the time. People come to the mall thinking “I’m going to get something” rather than “I’m going to donate something,” so that box is a little more like a donation box than a library. (But a book donation box is still pretty cool.) If our library was very looking a little too sparse I took a trip to a goodwill to pick up some popular book or series like The Hunger Games or the Magic Treehouse for a buck each. </p></li>\n<li><p>Keep a <em>reasonable</em> number of books in stock. Conversely, I’ve seen some Tiny Free Libraries with books stacked three deep and top to bottom, sometimes so tight that you can’t take a book out! If the books ever got piled deep, I’d remove some and cart them down to the donation box mentioned above. </p></li>\n<li><p>Keep only good books in stock. Be careful, this isn’t small-town-school-board censorship, but it is worthwhile to make sure you don’t have a lot of garbage books, which I consider things like torn or badly damaged books or books that most reasonably people wouldn’t not find interesting. (The Tiny Free Library people included in their starter kit for us a retrospective book about a small Minnesota festival. We are in Texas.) Magazines can be fine, in my opinion, if they aren’t ancient or battered. We even had some Christian magazines, because our community quite liked that kind of thing. (see below) Few books will actually have to be recycled; some long-ignored or damaged books went to the donation box from which all books are eventually taken. </p></li>\n<li><p>Stock books appropriate to the area of the library. Our HOA park includes a pool and a 2-5 year old playground. I always made sure we have pool-reading bestsellers and board books in stock. Board books went fast and weren’t always returned, so that was one of my priorities with my modest budget. In addition to Goodwill, I found cheap board books at Ross. We also have a rather mature clientele, based on the books that got left, and a quite literary one. The Dollar Tree is a weirdly good resource for cheap copies of recipients of the Booker and Orange prizes.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Rotate stock. If a book (or whole shelf) isn’t being touched, take it home, put it in your bookshelf and bring it again  later. Unsurprisingly , Christmas mysteries are not as popular in January as they were in December. </p></li>\n<li><p>Enjoy. I was pleased and surprised as the library quickly became part of our neighborhood. People would post on Nextdoor when they dropped off a couple of their favorite old paperbacks and when the box was moved during construction, everyone asked over it. During the pandemic, when the real library was closed, it was an important resource for some of the school kids and their parents. I loved watching books come and go on the shelves and imagine everyone sharing their favorite old books. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overall, keep the box 75-90% full of interesting books your community will like to read. </p>\n\n<p>I’m moving this year so I’ll be posting this information on Nextdoor in the hopes that another librarian will step in, but I hope it will help someone here who would also like to be a librarian of a tiny box of neighborhood books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p8oiir/notes_from_a_retired_tiny_free_librarian/","title":"Notes from a retired Tiny Free Librarian","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-21T10:59:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-21 10:59","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b0eb0fdf-c789-5bf2-aba8-499c8a70d004","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p8oiir/notes_from_a_retired_tiny_free_librarian/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p8oiir/notes_from_a_retired_tiny_free_librarian/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/gjOAGlKxfJr1WycD0JqQOq6q0-Ws5m-NeAU23sW1BMo.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=14462811d5bfd5c09d32ac9653b97d81e5edad79","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"uselessfoster","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/uselessfoster","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"uselessfoster","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"退職したTiny Free Librarianからのメモ","the_new_excerpt":"(図書館は小さくて空いているのは私ではない)。\n\n提案書を作ってHOAにプレゼンした結果、私のHOAの公園にTiny Free Library []が設置されました。\nLibrary [https://littlefreelibrary.org/] をHOAの公園に設置してもらいました。感謝の気持ちを込めて。\n私はその図書館の「司書」になることを引き受けました。これは、私にとって\n私にとっての意味は以下の通りです。\n\n * Take...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个退休的小自由图书馆员的笔记","the_new_excerpt":"(图书馆很小，而且是免费的，不是我）。)\n\n在编造了一个提案并向HOA介绍后，我得到了一个小小的免费图书馆。\n图书馆[https://littlefreelibrary.org/]安装在我的HOA公园。为了表示感谢。\n我自告奋勇成为图书馆的 \"图书管理员\"。以下是内容\n这对我意味着什么。\n\n *以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個退休的小自由圖書館員的筆記","the_new_excerpt":"(圖書館很小，而且是免費的，不是我）。)\n\n在編造了一個提案並向HOA介紹後，我得到了一個小小的免費圖書館。\n圖書館[https://littlefreelibrary.org/]安裝在我的HOA公園。爲了表示感謝。\n我自告奮勇成爲圖書館的 \"圖書管理員\"。以下是內容\n這對我意味着什麼。\n\n *以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6e5d940d-a43a-5407-8115-b4145611ee3d","excerpt":"Loved the characters, most of all Toranaga.
