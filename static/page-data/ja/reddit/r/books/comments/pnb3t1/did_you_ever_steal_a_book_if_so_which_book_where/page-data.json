Here&#39;s my brief story of book-thievery haha</p>\n\n<p>I was on the newspaper club in high school, first year I think, and the club meetings were always in the school library. This is in Serbia BTW, so all the books on the shelves are in Serbian, except for one that I found after extensive browsing - For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway, which was in English. I was always very good at English, went for competitions and stuff, was also very interested in learning more of the language, so finding this book got me excited and I took it. I couldn&#39;t comprehend the book at the time though, so I quickly gave up on reading it, but I wanted to own it for later reading. I don&#39;t remember ever asking the librarian for it, nor did I plan on giving it back, so in my mind I stole it, but somehow the librarian knew I had it and asked me to bring it back when I was graduating three years later. I was bummed out about it at first, but then it actually turned even better, because when I gave her the book she just opened the first page, penned a dedication for me and gave it back with a smile and best wishes in further education and life. That was really cool and I still hold that book near and dear to me. Though I still haven&#39;t read it, I&#39;ve been reading almost exclusively in English for the past three years, also lived abroad and spoke mainly in English for four years, so my comprehension level is much higher at this point and I can tackle it soon enough. One of the books I read in English was A Farewell To Arms, which I enjoyed very much, so I hope that For Whom The Bell Tolls is a great one as well, so it ads up to the story behind it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pnb3t1/did_you_ever_steal_a_book_if_so_which_book_where/","title":"Did you ever steal a book?
