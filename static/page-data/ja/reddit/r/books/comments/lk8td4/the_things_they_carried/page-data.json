Like every now and then when I’m trying to be deep, I remember the chapter where he says “But true war is never really about war. It’s about sunlight. It’s about the special way that dawn spreads out across a river when you know you must cross that river and walk into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do.” And I get the chills. Even now, I look at that and go damn. What a good frickin quote. Deep but not too complicated. Heartfelt without being preachy. How did he even think of that? I’m jealous of the skill but like, 10/10. I can’t find a single thing wrong with it no matter how hard I try. </p>\n\n<p>I know this book has been out for decades, but I recently picked it up after not reading it for a few years, and idk if it’s because I work in emergency services now or if it’s because I’m almost 30, but it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I think I cried like four times, and that’s saying a lot for me.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t read this book, please check it out. I promise you won’t regret it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lk8td4/the_things_they_carried/","title":"The Things They Carried","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T12:57:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 12:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cab1e228-d9ba-57d9-83a7-c84a12ba2b5e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lk8td4/the_things_they_carried/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lk8td4/the_things_they_carried/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"lady-fawkes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lady-fawkes","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lady-fawkes","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"他们携带的东西","the_new_excerpt":"我能不能花点时间来赞叹一下这本书有多好？它是如此的好\n它让我怀疑我作为一个作家的任何技能。就像每时每刻\n然后当我想深究的时候，我就会想起他说的那一章 \"但真正的\"。\n战争从来不是真正的战争。它是关于阳光。是关于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"他們攜帶的東西","the_new_excerpt":"我能不能花點時間來讚歎一下這本書有多好？它是如此的好\n它讓我懷疑我作爲一個作家的任何技能。就像每時每刻\n然後當我想深究的時候，我就會想起他說的那一章 \"但真正的\"。\n戰爭從來不是真正的戰爭。它是關於陽光。是關於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4718447d-dda3-50ca-9fe7-f2b6cec2a545","excerpt":"I am a sophomore in high school and I have never really liked reading before.
