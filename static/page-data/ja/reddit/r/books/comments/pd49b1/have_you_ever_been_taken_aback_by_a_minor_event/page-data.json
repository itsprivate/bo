Then quickly meets his future wife, a young Jamaican woman at an end of the world party with no apocalypse to justify it. The story plays a lot with time and history having characters of different ages and backgrounds at different periods in the 20th century. </p>\n\n<p>Having these two characters interact at very different periods of their lives having been intent on not living the next day was crazy for me to think about. It made me feel vastly better about the period of life I am and that I still have a lot of time to do the things I want to do. I was 21 when I read it (26 now) but I was having a lot of anxiety about falling behind in life. Being stuck in prison in the wake of a traumatic event will do that to you. My life was literally on hold, actually, worse than that. It was set back. I&#39;m still working hard to get to where I want to be in life having been out 4 and a half years at this point. But, that concept in the beginning and throughout the book, makes me feel that I shouldn&#39;t worry about it. Since, why do I have to be a certain age to do or be something? Life is chaotic and our impacts on it are often unforseen. Best not to stress it. </p>\n\n<p>I love the book. It takes a look at the lives of it&#39;s characters that is organic and very recognizable. The way Smith finds some humor in the difficult parts of life and the history that shapes it was very therapeutic to me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pd49b1/have_you_ever_been_taken_aback_by_a_minor_event/","title":"Have you ever been taken aback by a minor event or detail in a book?
