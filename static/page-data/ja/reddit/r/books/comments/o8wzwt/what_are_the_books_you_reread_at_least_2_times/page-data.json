Still Win Big by Scott Adams - No more words for this book, many of the self-help books took inspiration from this book because it just a masterpiece.</li>\n<li>The Obstacle Is The Way By Ryan Holiday - I can say he&#39;s the best stoic writer and he just brings Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus (<em>I can&#39;t easily comprehend these people&#39;s work easily without the help of a dictionary</em>) work in simple words and explains clearly with historical stories that happened in the past (<em>Also Ego Is the Enemy is also a great book IMO</em>)</li>\n<li>Man&#39;s Searching For Meaning by Viktor Frankl - You all already know why it&#39;s a masterpiece.</li>\n<li>Requiem For A Dream by  Hubert Selby - This doesn&#39;t come under re-reading because I&#39;m not that strong enough but I consider this is just a masterpiece. At first, my friend suggested me movie and also he said it was adopted from a novel, So I just picked the book and read it, I didn&#39;t understand few things but overall I felt it&#39;s fine and then, I watched the movie, it was more painful and I couldn&#39;t recommend enough to any teenager to read this book or watch the movie at least (<em>Mostly Movie</em>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, you may probably be thinking I&#39;m an amateur because I mostly mentioned self-help books, yes I read around 40+ and mostly are self-help genre.</p>\n\n<p>So, you can list yours, so that people here will understand what are some great books. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t hesitate if it&#39;s fiction or biographies or even self-help, list out any kind of genre and the right people will find them as a great recommendation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/o8wzwt/what_are_the_books_you_reread_at_least_2_times/","title":"What are the books you re-read at least 2 times?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-27T15:58:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-27 15:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4f5134a3-74bb-57a1-afd3-0fb87ab19bc6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o8wzwt/what_are_the_books_you_reread_at_least_2_times/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o8wzwt/what_are_the_books_you_reread_at_least_2_times/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"one_who_is_nerd","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/one_who_is_nerd","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"one_who_is_nerd","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2回以上読み直した本は何ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"> ここは本を勧めるサブではないことはわかっていますが、このサブは人々が素晴らしい本を見つけるのに役立ちます。\n> このサブにはより多くのメンバーが参加しているので、削除しないでください。\n> この投稿\n\n私は本を読むのは初めてで、去年読書の習慣を身につけたばかりで、いくつかの本を読みました。\n私は去年から読書の習慣を身につけたばかりで、いくつかの本を読みましたが、その中で印象的だったのは、その本を選ぶことでした。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"哪些书是你至少重读2遍的？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我知道这不是一个推荐书籍的子，但这有助于人们找到一些\n> 伟大的书籍，因为这个分站有更多的成员，所以请不要删除\n> 这个帖子\n\n我是个新书迷，去年才养成读书的习惯，读的书很少。\n我是个新书迷，去年刚养成了读书的习惯，读了一些书，有一件事让我印象深刻，那就是选...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"哪些書是你至少重讀2遍的？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我知道這不是一個推薦書籍的子，但這有助於人們找到一些\n> 偉大的書籍，因爲這個分站有更多的成員，所以請不要刪除\n> 這個帖子\n\n我是個新書迷，去年才養成讀書的習慣，讀的書很少。\n我是個新書迷，去年剛養成了讀書的習慣，讀了一些書，有一件事讓我印象深刻，那就是選...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ba1ec29b-b3ad-5bf6-acc1-230ca82ce97b","excerpt":"I have grown up reading Harry Potter several times..\n\nWill I be enchanted in the same manner by this book?","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/o8svbs/is_the_house_in_the_cerulean_sea_worth_reading/","title":"Is 'The House In The Cerulean Sea' worth reading?","date":"June 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The House In The Cerulean Sea」は読む価値がありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私はハリーポッターを何度も読んで育ってきました。\n\nこの本にも同じように魅了されるだろうか？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"The House In The Cerulean Sea》值得一读吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我是读着《哈利-波特》长大的，已经读了好几遍。\n\n我是否会以同样的方式被这本书迷住？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"The House In The Cerulean Sea》值得一讀嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我是讀着《哈利-波特》長大的，已經讀了好幾遍。\n\n我是否會以同樣的方式被這本書迷住？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-db136821-2f2b-505b-ae32-4cba3642d4b5","excerpt":"So, I tried to read 'The Lord Of The Rings' 2 years ago, but couldn't get into\nit..\n\nHave heard that 'The Hobbit' is a great cozy read..So should I go for it?
