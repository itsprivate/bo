It definitely had all that but also much more. First things first, the story was good. However, Flynn&#39;s structure of telling the current story from Nick&#39;s perspective and simultaneously adding Amy&#39;s perspective through diary flashbacks elevate it to very good. The latter half of the book has 2 points where the plot takes a sudden turn and it remains engrossing till the very end.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the prose and writing style was just what the book needed. It was direct and simple with a touch of edginess through certain vocabulary and references. You get as close you can to the characters as possible. Flynn covers all their feelings and thoughts precisely. The book could have been better edited as Nick&#39;s chapters could go for long sometimes, dwelling too much on his thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the characters. This is where I have heard criticism on the book. That none of the characters are likable enough. My question is, do they need to be? Further, are the characters all unlikable? Flynn writes her supporting characters well enough to not be cliches. The close sibling who does have her moments of doubt, the genius lawyer who doesn&#39;t always have the solution, the tough detective who is more than fair to her prime suspect and the loving parents who love the idea/image of their child as much as the child herself. These characters all feel real and 3 dimensional.</p>\n\n<p>But the story is about Nick and Amy and yes, they aren&#39;t exactly role models. Should main characters all be likable for a story to be good? If yes then movies like Joker or shows like Breaking Bad shouldn&#39;t work at all. I think a boring, predictable character is worse than a character who is not a good person. Amy is a very interesting character who you just want to know more about. It&#39;s hard not to feel for Nick at a certain stage because he doesn&#39;t deserve what goes on with him. The punishment is more than what he deserved and that alone makes you sympathetic towards him.\nSo, the characters too were nicely written. They stay with you for a while.</p>\n\n<p>A special mention to the cool girl monologue which is the most talked about passage from the book. I cannot say how true it is but it does open up your mind and makes you reflect. You use an idea from the book and start pondering about it in real life. To me that makes a book worthwhile. </p>\n\n<p>Gone Girl rating: 4/5.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pm51mp/gone_girl_is_a_compelling_read/","title":"Gone Girl is a compelling read.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"September 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-11T14:45:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-11 14:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pm51mp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pm51mp/gone_girl_is_a_compelling_read/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pm51mp/gone_girl_is_a_compelling_read/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Boss452","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boss452","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Boss452","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゴーン・ガール』は説得力のある読み物です。","the_new_excerpt":"私は、浮気や騙し、嘘や大げさなドラマを含む家庭内ドラマのありふれた本を期待していました。\n大げさなドラマを期待していました。しかし、それだけではなく、それ以上のものがありました。まず\nまず第一に、ストーリーは良かった。しかし、ニックの視点から現在のストーリーを語るというフリンの構成には\nニックの視点で現在の物語を語り、同時に...を加えるというフリンの構成は","locale":"ja"},{"title":"乱世佳人》是一本引人注目的读物。","the_new_excerpt":"我以为这是一本相当平凡的家庭戏剧书，涉及欺骗、欺诈。\n谎言和夸张的戏剧。这本书肯定有这些内容，但也有更多内容。首先\n首先，故事是好的。然而，弗林的结构是以尼克的视角讲述当前的故事。\n从尼克的角度讲述当前的故事，并同时加入...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亂世佳人》是一本引人注目的讀物。","the_new_excerpt":"我以爲這是一本相當平凡的家庭戲劇書，涉及欺騙、欺詐。\n謊言和誇張的戲劇。這本書肯定有這些內容，但也有更多內容。首先\n首先，故事是好的。然而，弗林的結構是以尼克的視角講述當前的故事。\n從尼克的角度講述當前的故事，並同時加入...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pm5q36","excerpt":"I'm not referring to books that I grew up with or books that were read to me\nwhen I was a kid; I'm referring to children's books that I discovered as an\nadult and enjoyed.\n\nBooks for ages 3-5.\n\nI don't have kids; my point being I have no reason to be reading kid's books;\nbut I do read and love…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pm5q36/as_an_adult_i_have_favorite_childrens_books_that/","title":"As an adult I have favorite children's books that I read over and over, and I'm wondering if anyone else does the same thing.","date":"September 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"大人になってもお気に入りの児童書があり、何度も読み返しているのですが、同じようなことをしている人はいるのでしょうか。","the_new_excerpt":"育った本や子供の頃に読んでもらった本のことではありません。\n子供の頃に読んでもらった本ではなく、大人になってから出会った子供の本のことです。\n大人になってから見つけて楽しんだ児童書のことです。\n\n3～5歳向けの本。\n\n私には子供がいないので、子供向けの本を読む理由がないということです。\nでも、私が読んで好きなのは...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"作为一个成年人，我有最喜欢的儿童读物，我反复阅读，我想知道是否有其他人做同样的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"我指的不是我长大的书，也不是我小时候读给我听的书。\n我指的是我在成年后发现的儿童书籍。\n我指的是我成年后发现并喜欢的儿童书籍。\n\n3-5岁的书。\n\n我没有孩子；我的意思是我没有理由去读儿童书籍。\n但我确实阅读并喜欢...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"作爲一個成年人，我有最喜歡的兒童讀物，我反覆閱讀，我想知道是否有其他人做同樣的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"我指的不是我長大的書，也不是我小時候讀給我聽的書。\n我指的是我在成年後發現的兒童書籍。\n我指的是我成年後發現並喜歡的兒童書籍。\n\n3-5歲的書。\n\n我沒有孩子；我的意思是我沒有理由去讀兒童書籍。\n但我確實閱讀並喜歡...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pm8nbz","excerpt":"My 16 yr old daughter (high-functioning autistic) just declared Animal Farm to\nbe the best book ever after finishing a recent school assignment. tears of joy\nBefore now, she has really only read small pieces of info; trivia, world\nrecords, jokes..
