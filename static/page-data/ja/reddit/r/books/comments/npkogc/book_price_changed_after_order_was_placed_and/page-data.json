What happened today is making me reconsider that. Here&#39;s the message I sent to the Support people today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Price changed AFTER order was placed, and then order apparently deleted</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I placed order #1005-9453305 at 4:37 PM this evening for a book from Booktown USA in CA. The book price was $2.16, with shipping and handling of $4.01 and tax of $0.14 -  a total of $6.31.  </p>\n\n<p>At 4:53 PM I received an email via Biblio from Booktown demanding an ADDITIONAL $7.31 for &quot;S&amp;H&quot;. No additional information was given. If I don&#39;t pay, the order will be canceled.  </p>\n\n<p>More than doubling the effective price after the purchase was made is the height of dishonesty. I hope that <a href=\"https://Biblio.com\">Biblio.com</a> doesn&#39;t allow this sort of sleazy behavior from the bookstores that sell on your site, and I would urge you to remove Booktown USA from the sellers represented on Biblio.  </p>\n\n<p>I will cancel my order and look for my books elsewhere until I receive some assurance that Biblio requires ethical behavior from their sellers.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: After attempting to send this message to <a href=\"https://Biblio.com\">Biblio.com</a> via the Contact option on the site, my support request was apparently deleted because my order suddenly &quot;didn&#39;t exist&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, something is seriously wrong here. My decision to no longer shop with <a href=\"https://Biblio.com\">Biblio.com</a> is reinforced by this experience, and I will encourage others to avoid the site as well if this issue is not addressed.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/npkogc/book_price_changed_after_order_was_placed_and/","title":"Book price changed AFTER order was placed, and then order & complaint apparently deleted","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-01T18:37:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-01 18:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"npkogc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/npkogc/book_price_changed_after_order_was_placed_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/npkogc/book_price_changed_after_order_was_placed_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"BobQuasit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BobQuasit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BobQuasit","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"注文後に書籍の価格が変更され、その後、注文と苦情が削除されたようです。","the_new_excerpt":"私は、Biblio.com [https://Biblio.com]で多くの本を手に入れてきました。\n多くの人に勧めてきました。今日起こったことは\n私はそのことを考え直しています。私がサポートの方々に送ったメッセージは以下の通りです。\ntoday:\n\n> 注文した後に価格が変更され、その後、注文が明らかに...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"书价在下单后发生了变化，然后订单和投诉明显被删除。","the_new_excerpt":"多年来，我通过Biblio.com[https://Biblio.com]得到了很多书。\n多年来，我向很多人推荐过这些书。今天发生的事情\n让我重新考虑这个问题。以下是我发给支持人员的信息\n今天。\n\n> 下单后价格发生变化，然后订单显然...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"書價在下單後發生了變化，然後訂單和投訴明顯被刪除。","the_new_excerpt":"多年來，我通過Biblio.com[https://Biblio.com]得到了很多書。\n多年來，我向很多人推薦過這些書。今天發生的事情\n讓我重新考慮這個問題。以下是我發給支持人員的信息\n今天。\n\n> 下單後價格發生變化，然後訂單顯然...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-nps13l","excerpt":"I have never read any hard sci-fi books, but I want to try one.
