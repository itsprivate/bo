I thought that it was super overrated. \nFirst off, I thought that the climax of the book was all around underwhelming. Specifically, I thought that the trial and murder of Chase Andrews was too predictable which subsequently undermined the gravitas of the whole trial. The flashback sequences of the murder of Chasw Andrews and Kya’s youth totally gave it away that Kya would be accused, so after a while it just felt inevitable for Kya to be accused of the murder and made each chapter about the murder bland.  I also thought that Kya’s character arch of becoming a woman and overcoming her trauma of abandonment was unearned. Her issues were resolved by someone saying to her “give Tate another chance” after like 4 years. My problem with her arch was that there was no real tangible moment/occurrence where she really had to grow as a character, it was just literally not seeing Tate for years and him groveling for her to take him back. Another issue I had with the book was the use of detail by Owens. I thought the author really forced the whole “Kya is a smart person” idea. For example, I just cringed every time the author tried to prove to the audience that Kya was knowledgeable about the Marsh by bogging every sentence down with biological/ecological jargon. I understand that the author was a biologist (which probably influenced her writing), but she did not need to shove it down our throats every sentence. I get sick of “that was a crane feather, Kya knew that it was a crane feather because she saw it in a book and because it had this color for camouflage and mating” every sentence. I also had issues with the author trying to force symbolism. I thought that Owens tried too hard to make the Marsh seem like a character or something symbolic for Kya through the weather and how Kya was feeling, but I just feel like it was so forced. All in all, a lot of cliches and forced ideas. 2/10. </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on about this book. I just thought it was overrated. Am I the only one? </p>\n\n<p>(Sorry for the tangent/rant)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p0wcwe/unpopular_opinion_where_the_crawdads_sing_is/","title":"Unpopular opinion: Where the Crawdads sing is overrated (SPOILERS)","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-09T18:35:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-09 18:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p0wcwe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p0wcwe/unpopular_opinion_where_the_crawdads_sing_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p0wcwe/unpopular_opinion_where_the_crawdads_sing_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"MeaningfulAbsurdist","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MeaningfulAbsurdist","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MeaningfulAbsurdist","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不評な意見。クローダズの歌声は過大評価されている（SPOILERS","the_new_excerpt":"この本の宣伝文句を聞いて、この夏、楽しみに読んでみることにしました。\n楽しみにしています。私は、超過大評価だと思いました。まず第一に、クライマックスの\n本のクライマックスは全体的に圧倒されました。具体的には、チェイス・アンドリューズの裁判と殺人は\nチェイス・アンドリューズの裁判と殺人があまりにも予測可能で、それが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"不受欢迎的意见。爬虫唱歌的地方被高估了（SPOILERS）。","the_new_excerpt":"我听说这本书被炒得很热，于是决定在今年夏天阅读这本书。\n乐趣。我认为这本书的评价太高了。首先，我认为这本书的高潮部分\n首先，我认为这本书的高潮部分完全没有说服力。具体而言，我认为审判\n和谋杀切斯-安德鲁斯的过程太可预测了，这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不受歡迎的意見。爬蟲唱歌的地方被高估了（SPOILERS）。","the_new_excerpt":"我聽說這本書被炒得很熱，於是決定在今年夏天閱讀這本書。\n樂趣。我認爲這本書的評價太高了。首先，我認爲這本書的高潮部分\n首先，我認爲這本書的高潮部分完全沒有說服力。具體而言，我認爲審判\n和謀殺切斯-安德魯斯的過程太可預測了，這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p0xkyz","excerpt":"I dont even know why I have such an absolute visceral feeling of disgust towards\nthe book.\n\nIt's not even cause it's depressing because depressing shit is my bread and\nbutter.\n\nIs it cause its akin to trauma porn?\n\nI think it's because everyone in the book is absolutely miserable and no one\ntakes…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p0xkyz/the_god_of_small_things_is_the_most_miserable/","title":"The God of Small Things is the most miserable book I have ever read","date":"August 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The God of Small Things』は、今まで読んだ本の中で最も悲惨な本です。","the_new_excerpt":"なぜこんなにも嫌悪感があるのか、自分でもわかりません。\nこの本に嫌悪感を抱く理由がわからない。\n\n憂鬱だからというわけでもなく、憂鬱なものは私の糧であり\n憂鬱な気分にさせられるからだ。\n\nトラウマ・ポルノに似ているからでしょうか？\n\nこの本に出てくる人たちは、誰もが絶対的に惨めで、誰もいないからだと思います。\n誰もが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"小事之神》是我读过的最悲惨的书","the_new_excerpt":"我甚至不知道为什么我对这本书有一种绝对内脏的厌恶感\n这本书。\n\n这甚至不是因为它很压抑，因为压抑的东西是我的面包和黄油。\n黄油。\n\n是不是因为它类似于创伤性色情？\n\n我认为这是因为书中的每个人都是绝对悲惨的，没有人\n把...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"小事之神》是我讀過的最悲慘的書","the_new_excerpt":"我甚至不知道爲什麼我對這本書有一種絕對內臟的厭惡感\n這本書。\n\n這甚至不是因爲它很壓抑，因爲壓抑的東西是我的麪包和黃油。\n黃油。\n\n是不是因爲它類似於創傷性色情？\n\n我認爲這是因爲書中的每個人都是絕對悲慘的，沒有人\n把...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-p154r5","excerpt":"I have just finished Herbert's Dune, and what a captivating story it was!\n\nA TV show based on Asimov's Foundation and a movie based on Herbert's Dune both\ncome out this fall, so I figured I should read the books first — I used to read\na lot of sci-fi as a kid, but somehow missed these two series.
