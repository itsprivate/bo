I&#39;m new to the sub and don&#39;t really have any friends who are &quot;readers&quot;. I wanted to say this to someone who might grock it.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I read the book was in highschool when the school board published a list of banned books. I was irritated by the irony of banning a book about why it&#39;s wrong to ban books, so of course I borrowed a copy and devoured it, looking for some deep message that would clearly change my life. (In retrospect, I wonder if a lot of those books were put on the list to trick rebellious teenagers into reading books we&#39;d otherwise skim the cliff notes for.) </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t get the big deal. Books good, McCarthyism sucks, the cold war scary, Mildred&#39;s a twit. So what?</p>\n\n<p>I read it again at about 25, thinking maybe being older and wiser I&#39;d get something out of it I didn&#39;t before. </p>\n\n<p>Nope. Books good, McCarthyism sucks, the cold war scary, Mildred&#39;s now a spineless twit. Realizing the hound was a mechanical combination of the three things that terrify me did give me a couple nightmares though. (Dogs, spiders, and needles.)</p>\n\n<p>Then a few years ago, I read an article that Ray Bradbury had walked out of a guest lecture after being harassed by a student at UCLA. According to the article, Bradbury had asserted that the book wasn&#39;t about censorship, it was about his hatred of mass media and television. And the student in her infinite wisdom asserted <em>he was wrong</em>. So with this new information I&#39;d verified, when I was at a second hand store a few months ago and saw a copy for sale, I immediately bought it and put it on my list of books to read this year. I started it on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>I am dizzy.</p>\n\n<p>LiveJournal&#39;s block of text gave way to MySpace&#39;s glittery backgrounds and music, who in turn gave way to Facebook&#39;s ever refreshing live feed and easier meme sharing. Soon came Twitter&#39;s 160 characters and Snapchat and Instagram. YouTube videos are too long for us now, so after Vine died it&#39;s TikTok. The news is 24 hours and almost nothing is talked about (and rarely actually discussed) for more than a day or two. The natural disaster that kills thousands and leaves more displaced until some celebrity is caught in a scandal a few days later. These celebrities we&#39;ve built our families and stories like Millie&#39;s our of silicone filled reality TV stars and autotuned singers.</p>\n\n<p>In the U.S. we&#39;ve been <sup>this</sup> <sup>close</sup> to war with Russia or China or North Korea so many times, most people largely ignore it. (Remember in 2020, right before Corona,  when we nearly went to war with Iran? Why was that again?) We also shrug off the cyber attacks on our elections and banking and resources.</p>\n\n<p>Bradbury only died in 2012, and I wonder what he thought about this digital age we&#39;ve created so soon after he warned us about it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ohsryt/third_time_reading_fahrenheit_451_first_time/","title":"Third time reading Fahrenheit 451, first time reading it after knowing Ray Bradbury's intentions, and it finally blew my mind.
