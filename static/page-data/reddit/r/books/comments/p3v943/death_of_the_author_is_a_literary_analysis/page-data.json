But both of these are choices.</p>\n\n<p>For example if you read <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>, and you also decide to research the antebellum South&#39;s history, and Mark Twain&#39;s politics, and the public commentary he made elsewhere, and appreciate the book&#39;s apparent message as a product of it&#39;s time, that&#39;s an act <em>in defiance of</em> the Death of the Author approach.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically enough, someone who decides to ignore all of that context (or someone who is naturally ignoarnt of it), opens the book, sees a sentence using the n-word, and immediately get offended, is practicing a crude form of Death of the Author analysis: &quot;I don&#39;t care what this Mark guy originally <em>meant</em> by this, or what a nice guy he was, <em>to me,</em> in 2021, it feels insulting&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>H.P. Lovecraft is another infamous example, where the usual defenders of &quot;problematic&quot; classics, would probably be better off appealing to more context, than to less:</p>\n\n<p>Researching his life&#39;s history in any capacity, one might confirm that he was a huge bigot, sure, but also that both of his parents died in asylums, and that the threat of inferiority or madness lurking in one&#39;s own heredity, was something very <em>intimately horrifying</em> to him, not <strong><em>just</em></strong> a racial thing.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, anyone invited to simply read a story like &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot; while consciously ignoring any authorial context, could still <em>easily</em> come to the conclusion that even on a first read, it sounds transparently like some sort of allegory about race mixing.</p>\n\n<p>Which is of course a limitation of Death of the Author: We might choose not to read (or to ignore) interviews that the author made right after publishing a book, explainging what it&#39;s message was, and we can choose not to read their wikipedia biography and psychoanalize them.</p>\n\n<p>But we are still living in the world, we are familiar with it&#39;s politics and moral agendas, with tropes and coding, and we won&#39;t be entirely blind to the idea that books usually have messages and themes.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing not to indulge in speculation over what the author&#39;s original ones might have been, isn&#39;t the same thing as not reading <em>anything</em> into them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p3v943/death_of_the_author_is_a_literary_analysis/","title":"\"Death of the Author\" is a literary analysis approach, not a thought-terminating cliché!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-14T01:30:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-14 01:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p3v943","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p3v943/death_of_the_author_is_a_literary_analysis/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p3v943/death_of_the_author_is_a_literary_analysis/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Genoscythe_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Genoscythe_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Genoscythe_","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"Death of the Author \"は文学分析の手法であり、思考停止の決まり文句ではありません","the_new_excerpt":"最近、私がよく目にするのは、「作家の死」という言葉が、「芸術から作家を切り離さなければならない」などの決まり文句と同義に使われていることです。\n芸術家と芸術を切り離さなければならない」というような決まり文句と同義で使われることが多い。\nこの本は問題がある」とか「この本は問題がある」とか、文化戦争的な意味合いで使われています。\n「問題がある」と。\n\n残念なことに、本来の文学的...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"作者之死 \"是一种文学分析方法，而不是一种思想终结的陈词滥调!","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我最常看到的是 \"作者之死 \"与 \"你必须把艺术家和艺术分开 \"等陈词滥调同义。\n诸如 \"你必须把艺术家和艺术分开 \"之类的陈词滥调，在文化战争的废话中抛来抛去。\n文化战争的废话，在这本书或那本书是否有 \"问题 \"的防卫方面\n\"有问题\"。\n\n这是一种耻辱，因为原来的文学...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"作者之死 \"是一種文學分析方法，而不是一種思想終結的陳詞濫調!","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我最常看到的是 \"作者之死 \"與 \"你必須把藝術家和藝術分開 \"等陳詞濫調同義。\n諸如 \"你必須把藝術家和藝術分開 \"之類的陳詞濫調，在文化戰爭的廢話中拋來拋去。\n文化戰爭的廢話，在這本書或那本書是否有 \"問題 \"的防衛方面\n\"有問題\"。\n\n這是一種恥辱，因爲原來的文學...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p3v6zg","excerpt":"Kinda a weird question but I'm just thinking about the books I've read, which as\na dyslexic who was never terribly invested in books isn't many but I'm getting\nback into them now.
