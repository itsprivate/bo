I am generally considered a smart person, however I have always had issues with reading comprehension. It is the same way for me when I am given an audiobook. I do not know what is going on most of the time. The only book that I somehow ever managed to make it through was House of Leaves bY Mark Z Danielewski, so I am capable of it, i am sure. I have no issues understanding and comprehending text in other situations, because I text my friends all the time and am able to understand them. I also write a lot and have written a short story of 40,000 words. However, even Harry Potter seems impossible and daunting to get through. I just do not understand what is happening, even with an audiobook. This issue seems to be affectIng me in other areas, especially schoolwork where I am learning subjects such as biology which are very text-heavy. If anyone has any ideas what Is going on in my brain, let me know. Or at least please give me leads to someone who might.</p>\n\n<p>It is just frustrating because I know people that can easily go through a book a day and it comes as naturally to them as simply writing. \nIt would help me immensely.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pvqnk9/why_cant_i_comprehend_any_book_i_read/","title":"Why can't I comprehend any book I read","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"September 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-26T13:57:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-26 13:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pvqnk9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pvqnk9/why_cant_i_comprehend_any_book_i_read/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pvqnk9/why_cant_i_comprehend_any_book_i_read/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"fairlynx6","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fairlynx6","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"fairlynx6","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ、どんな本を読んでも理解できないのか？","the_new_excerpt":"本を読んでいると、何度も読み返して確認することがあります。\n何を言っているのか理解するためには、何度も本文を見直さなければなりませんが、それでも本の中で何が語られているのかはっきりしません。\n本の中で何が語られているのかわからない。私は一般的には頭が良い方だと思われます。\nしかし、読解力にはいつも問題がありました。それは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么我不能理解我读的任何书","the_new_excerpt":"当我在阅读一本书时，我发现我必须将文本翻阅数遍\n来理解文本的内容，但即使如此，我仍然不清楚书中提到的是什么。\n书中所提到的内容。我一般被认为是个聪明人。\n然而，我在阅读理解方面一直有问题。它是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我不能理解我讀的任何書","the_new_excerpt":"當我在閱讀一本書時，我發現我必須將文本翻閱數遍\n來理解文本的內容，但即使如此，我仍然不清楚書中提到的是什麼。\n書中所提到的內容。我一般被認爲是個聰明人。\n然而，我在閱讀理解方面一直有問題。它是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pvmytl","excerpt":"My to-read list is also 47 books long already.
