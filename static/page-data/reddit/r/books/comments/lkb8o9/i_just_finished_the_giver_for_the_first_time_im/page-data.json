I over think things and after having to re read so many pages because my mind is somewhere else I got discouraged and I think I became afraid of reading. Tonight I finished The Giver for the first time after my best friend recommended it to me. I have never sobbed after reading a book before until tonight. I have never felt so much empathy for characters and so much heart ache after finishing a story. I am regretful of how many years I&#39;ve gone without reading, but I feel like this may have changed everything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lkb8o9/i_just_finished_the_giver_for_the_first_time_im/","title":"I just finished The Giver for the first time.
