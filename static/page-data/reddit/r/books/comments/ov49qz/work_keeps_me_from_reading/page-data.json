Once I return home I relax from work for half an hour but then have to do some cooking/cleaning some sports/training - showering - preparing stuff for the next day - laundry - dinner ect. This leaves me around one hour in the evening where I can read before I have to go to sleep. And I dont even watch TV. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I have even less time in the evening because I have to buy some groceries on the way home, meet with a friend, repair stuff, call friends/family ect </p>\n\n<p>Yet I hear from some people that they come home - drop everything and read for like 4-5 hours every evening before going to sleep. Like when do you do all the other stuff? I have to do most of the housework mentioned above or my apprtment would be a total mess. I &quot;have to&quot; meet up/keep in touch with family/friends or I would be a total loner. I simply cannot fathom to read for several hours after work because then I would have no time left for anything else and my life would be a total mess.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ov49qz/work_keeps_me_from_reading/","title":"Work keeps me from reading","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"July 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-31T19:33:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-31 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b0557892-dd27-57cb-ab76-c8644da2de4b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ov49qz/work_keeps_me_from_reading/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ov49qz/work_keeps_me_from_reading/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"AlexanderDenorius","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexanderDenorius","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AlexanderDenorius","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"仕事で読書から遠ざかっている","the_new_excerpt":"朝7時に起床し、午後6時に帰宅します - 仕事中に読書ができない仕事をしています。\nの仕事をしています。帰宅後、30分は仕事から解放されますが、その後は\n料理、掃除、スポーツ、トレーニング、シャワー、次の日の準備、洗濯、夕食など。\n翌日の準備、洗濯、夕食などなど。これでは1時間くらいしか時間がありません...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"工作使我无法阅读","the_new_excerpt":"我早上7点起床，下午6点回家--我有一份工作，我不能在工作中阅读。\n工作。一旦我回到家，我就会从工作中放松半小时，但随后要做的是\n做饭/打扫卫生、运动/训练--洗澡--准备第二天的东西--洗衣--吃饭等等。\n第二天--洗衣服--吃饭等等。这给我留下了大约一...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"工作使我無法閱讀","the_new_excerpt":"我早上7點起牀，下午6點回家--我有一份工作，我不能在工作中閱讀。\n工作。一旦我回到家，我就會從工作中放鬆半小時，但隨後要做的是\n做飯/打掃衛生、運動/訓練--洗澡--準備第二天的東西--洗衣--喫飯等等。\n第二天--洗衣服--喫飯等等。這給我留下了大約一...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-334fbcf4-3e26-5baa-85f7-98fbc15166e6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ovbni3/sir_terry_pratchetts_daughter_shuts_down/","title":"Sir Terry Pratchett's daughter shuts down 'horrifying' claims that author would be a transphobe if he were alive","date":"July 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テリー・プラチェット卿の娘が「もし彼が生きていたらトランスフォビアになっていた」という「恐ろしい」主張を封じ込める","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"特里-普拉切特爵士的女儿驳斥了 \"可怕 \"的说法，即如果作者在世，他将是一个变性人。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"特里-普拉切特爵士的女兒駁斥了 \"可怕 \"的說法，即如果作者在世，他將是一個變性人。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b0557892-dd27-57cb-ab76-c8644da2de4b","previousId":"RedditPost-334fbcf4-3e26-5baa-85f7-98fbc15166e6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ov49qz/work_keeps_me_from_reading/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
