However, like one month before initial covid lockdown I bought some books dirt cheap and had them laying around with minimal intentions of really reading them. Once lockdown started, no job all day in the house very mundane and repetitive days I realised I needed to do something. That’s when I picked up my first book in probably a year. American sniper. I was really surprised how quickly I got hooked and how quick I finished it. I started my next book and within 2 months I went through my pile of something like 5 books which was crazy for me. Now covid has kinda levelled of and I got a job and live a busy life I just can’t stop reading. I just read a book in one week which is a record for me and I just purchased three more. It has brought enjoyment and something to look forward to and probably most importantly excitement. Everyday being the same in lockdown at least when I picked up a book I didn’t know what was ahead and I was in my own separate world so to say. Maybe coincidentally it improved my English literature as my exam results gave me an A overall in English I’d like to say books played a part in that achievement? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading\nMy punctuation may be off as I am typing this relatively fast :D</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oqtjhz/if_there_is_one_good_thing_covid_brought_it_is/","title":"If there is one good thing covid brought.
