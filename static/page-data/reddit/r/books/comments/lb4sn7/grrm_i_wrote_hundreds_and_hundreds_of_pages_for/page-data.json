Now he&#39;s also consulting with HBO to produce the House of the Dragon and the Dunk &amp; Egg series so it&#39;s great that he&#39;s feeling optimistic. I think it&#39;s been said in a million times but I&#39;m really hoping to see how this contrasts with what we&#39;ve seen before in the show and I&#39;m hoping to see the final few acts of the complete story fully detailed since DnD did a poor job handling that. This series is one of the top fantasy series alongside Wot and LoTR and I hope this can get the ending that it deserves. I also appreciate how Martin has been rolling up his sleeves over the past year to finish out this book.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/lb4sn7/grrm_i_wrote_hundreds_and_hundreds_of_pages_for/","title":"GRRM: I wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages for Winds of Winter in 2021","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T02:15:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 02:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"lb4sn7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lb4sn7/grrm_i_wrote_hundreds_and_hundreds_of_pages_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lb4sn7/grrm_i_wrote_hundreds_and_hundreds_of_pages_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Matrim_WoT","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Matrim_WoT","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Matrim_WoT","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GRRM：我在2021年为《冬之风》写了几百页几百页的内容","the_new_excerpt":"他还说，还有几百本就可以完成了。\n并画上了一个满意的句号。\n\n> 我在2020年写了几百页的《寒冬之风》。的\n> 我在WOW上度过的最好的一年，因为我开始它。为什么呢？ - 我不知道 - Why? 我也不知道 I don't know. 也许是\n> 隔离。或者我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GRRM：我在2021年爲《冬之風》寫了幾百頁幾百頁的內容","the_new_excerpt":"他還說，還有幾百本就可以完成了。\n並畫上了一個滿意的句號。\n\n> 我在2020年寫了幾百頁的《寒冬之風》。的\n> 我在WOW上度過的最好的一年，因爲我開始它。爲什麼呢？ - 我不知道 - Why? 我也不知道 I don't know. 也許是\n> 隔離。或者我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lawbrc","excerpt":"Currently I'm reading Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood and this book is\nterrifying.
