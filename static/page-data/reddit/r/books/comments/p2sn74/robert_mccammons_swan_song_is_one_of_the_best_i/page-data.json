Spending all of your time on social media, especially a website like Twitter, will erode your mental health like spending your free time in a radioactive crater. Eventually, you will get cancer. And die.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, though a variety of factors, I kicked my addiction to social media, and left Twitter for good.</p>\n\n<p>One of those factors was Swan Song.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I am a gamer. I play a wide selection of video games, and my favorite video game series is Fallout. You could tell that if you went on my profile, and I could go on a rant about how deep Fallout New Vegas is, the excellent world-building of Fallout 1, and how Fallout 2 has literal hundreds of cultural references to other media. Fallout has made a big part of my identity and shaped who I am.</p>\n\n<p>But, all the entries Fallout does get boring after you play it for the thousandth time, so I wanted to read something. Something post-apocalyptic like my beloved series, but also thoughtful, not having just mindless action but not so philosophically it makes your brain cramp out.</p>\n\n<p>Swan Song was this.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I must thank Swan Song for just making me read again. It brushed away a lot of the cobwebs in my mind caused by not reading for an entire year (I am still mad I was a dumbass and sent my year on Twitter instead of reading and running and playing Fallout).</p>\n\n<p>The extremely bare bones of bare bones plot summary is that the world got nuked and you follow three plotines of survivors, Joshua and Swan, Sister and Paul Thorson, and Colonel Macklin and Roland Croninger. Throughout the book, they all come together and eventually meet each other in the end, to a final confrontation. It&#39;s amazing to think about what the characters went through to get to where they are in the end and how they changed. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the main strength of Swan Song was not its plot, but simply how it is written.</p>\n\n<p>There is just something that makes you read it, eager to know more. Even though it is 919 pages (in my paperback version), I barely got tired of it. The only times I got frustrated was when I thought it didn&#39;t spend enough time on the Colonel Macklin/Roland Croninger storyline and too much on Swan/Joshua and Sister/Thorson.</p>\n\n<p>Not only that, I just realized as I writing this on many plot lines and characters there are. The thing is, the way McCammon writes is that I remember distinctly which characters are who and their personality. They are unique. I never groaned when a new character entered the picture. I was excited.</p>\n\n<p>Even the minor characters spice up the story. In one scene, the main antagonist of the book, the Man with the Scarlet Eye, convinces a woman to kill herself for fun after she finds him doing things with his anatomy humans cannot do.</p>\n\n<p>Little snippets of data about how other groups of humans and communities are doing feel so realistic. You seen how people and communities are reacting to the nuclear holocaust, so hearing about how people are suffering don&#39;t feel like they were added in and actually exist.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, one of the most emphasized parts of the book is on the characters humanity. They can get injured, disfigured, even killed. They aren&#39;t immortal. They feel human emotions like sadness, grief, jealousy, zealotry, ruthless, but there are moments were they hope, laugh, love, and persevere against the onslaught of this new world.</p>\n\n<p>One of the morals of the book is that people are people, with flaws and all.</p>\n\n<p>You see the faces of evil, quite literally in some parts with the Man in the Scarlet Eye, yet there are people like Swan who still hope for the best of people, and try hard to bring them together, to cooperate and not steal, to love and to not hate, and to replace suspicion with friendship and camaraderie.</p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, humanity had a love affair with fire...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>PS: I would like to thank this lady, Emily Fox for recommending this book in this video. You helped me find a book that has influenced my life to a most definite degree! </p>\n\n<p>Video:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O936FDARzys\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O936FDARzys</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p2sn74/robert_mccammons_swan_song_is_one_of_the_best_i/","title":"Robert McCammon's Swan Song is One of the Best I have Ever Read.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-12T11:17:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-12 11:17","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"464de20f-15f3-53bc-867b-1cbed482cc36","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p2sn74/robert_mccammons_swan_song_is_one_of_the_best_i/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p2sn74/robert_mccammons_swan_song_is_one_of_the_best_i/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/X6Byplz5Fn7SQnNzdMB8LUPpQ_40GWcTgJAIV6Gdk5U.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=817412b34de0b7ea415a153b6b5fb31e25de9974","video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"DogeIsATroller","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DogeIsATroller","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DogeIsATroller","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロバート・マカモンの『Swan Song』は、これまでに読んだ中で最高の作品のひとつです。","the_new_excerpt":"2020年の隔離期間中、私は1冊も本を読みませんでした。記憶に残っているものでも\n思い出せるものは一つもない。\n\nこれはもちろん、悪いことでした。ソーシャルメディア、特にツイッターのようなサイトに時間を費やしていると\n放射能汚染されたクレーターで自由な時間を過ごすように、精神的な健康を損なうことになります。\n放射能に汚染されたクレーターの中で自由な時間を過ごすように、あなたの精神衛生を蝕みます。結局、あなたは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"罗伯特-麦卡蒙的《天鹅之歌》是我读过的最佳作品之一。","the_new_excerpt":"在2020年的隔离期间，我没有读一本书。或者说，我可以\n记得的书。\n\n这当然很糟糕。把所有的时间都花在社交媒体上，尤其是\n像推特这样的网站，会侵蚀你的心理健康，就像把你的空闲时间花在放射性火山口一样。\n侵蚀你的心理健康，就像把你的空闲时间花在一个放射性火山口上。最终，你会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"羅伯特-麥卡蒙的《天鵝之歌》是我讀過的最佳作品之一。","the_new_excerpt":"在2020年的隔離期間，我沒有讀一本書。或者說，我可以\n記得的書。\n\n這當然很糟糕。把所有的時間都花在社交媒體上，尤其是\n像推特這樣的網站，會侵蝕你的心理健康，就像把你的空閒時間花在放射性火山口一樣。\n侵蝕你的心理健康，就像把你的空閒時間花在一個放射性火山口上。最終，你會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6bb72085-be02-5db0-b3d4-db2a730403ec","excerpt":"I just finished Death with Interruptions by José Saramago.\n\nThe premise: What if one day everyone stopped dying?\n\nThe execution: Read like a dry philosophy book that I didn't find interesting or\nengaging.\n\nGot any good examples of something that sounded fantastic as a concept but ended\nup being…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p2l9vh/what_book_had_an_excellent_premise_but_completely/","title":"What book had an excellent premise but completely turned you off with the execution?","date":"August 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"優れた前提があっても、それを完全に否定してしまった本は？","the_new_excerpt":"ジョゼ・サラマーゴの「Death with Interruptions」を読み終えました。\n\n前提：もしある日、みんなが死ななくなったら？\n\nその結果。乾いた哲学書のような読み心地で、面白みも魅力も感じませんでした。\n魅力を感じませんでした。\n\nコンセプトとしては素晴らしくても、結局は......というような良い例はありませんか？\n何か良い例はありませんか？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"哪本书有一个很好的前提，但在执行上却让你完全失望？","the_new_excerpt":"我刚刚读完何塞-萨拉马戈的《死亡与中断》。\n\n前提是：如果有一天每个人都不再死亡，会怎么样？\n\n执行情况。读起来就像一本枯燥的哲学书，我不觉得有趣或\n吸引力。\n\n有什么好的例子可以说明，作为一个概念听起来很好，但最后却\n但最后却被...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"哪本書有一個很好的前提，但在執行上卻讓你完全失望？","the_new_excerpt":"我剛剛讀完何塞-薩拉馬戈的《死亡與中斷》。\n\n前提是：如果有一天每個人都不再死亡，會怎麼樣？\n\n執行情況。讀起來就像一本枯燥的哲學書，我不覺得有趣或\n吸引力。\n\n有什麼好的例子可以說明，作爲一個概念聽起來很好，但最後卻\n但最後卻被...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6e5dd027-650d-5d6b-aa07-5bda1aaeadfc","excerpt":"I apologize in advance for the format of this post - I wrote it after finishing\nthe book at about midnight, and couldn’t be bothered to write formally.
