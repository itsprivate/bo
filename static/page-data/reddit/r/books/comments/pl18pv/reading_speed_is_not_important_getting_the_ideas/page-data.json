But the amount of self-help literature and threads here on reddit that purport to be able to teach you to &quot;speed-read&quot; show how much interest people still have in acquiring this ability. To me, it&#39;s analogous to trying to become better at travelling to where you want to go by becoming a marathon runner. Perhaps you can actually become better at running long distances, but have you heard of this fancy new invention called the bicycle?</p>\n\n<p>The bicycle of reading is Information Technology. Ancient Sumerians did not need courses to learn memory techniques; as soon as some priest started tallying bushels of wheat on a slab of wet clay, they enjoyed the ability to <em>flawlessly</em> recollect information across years and lifetimes, far beyond what is even possible for most humans working just with their minds. From clay to computers, what is what our technology does for us, recollection, there&#39;s no point focusing so much on improving the rate at which information enters your mind (assuming that is even possible to do to a dramatic extent/ without you finding a way to use this ability. Some people are going to prefer writing in paper notebooks, others will use digital bibliographic databases like Zotero. Either way is better than reading as fast as possible and trusting yourself to remember it all. Two years from now, you aren&#39;t going to care about whether it took three weeks or six to read a book, you&#39;re going to care about whether or not you recorded the basics of the main ideas of interest to you and where in the book you found them, in a place and format that is easy for you to access again. Do you want to be able to comprehensively recall a single book years after you read it, or do you want to look at the covers of two books and struggle to remember a single thing about either of them?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pl18pv/reading_speed_is_not_important_getting_the_ideas/","title":"Reading speed is not important, getting the ideas from the book is.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"September 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-09T18:26:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-09 18:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pl18pv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pl18pv/reading_speed_is_not_important_getting_the_ideas/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pl18pv/reading_speed_is_not_important_getting_the_ideas/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"1945BestYear","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/1945BestYear","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"1945BestYear","score":90,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"読むスピードは重要ではなく、本からアイデアを得ることが重要です。","the_new_excerpt":"要するに、本から学んだことを、すでに知っていることに加えるようにプロセスを改善することは\nページをより早く仕上げる方法を学ぶよりも、本から学んだことをすでに知っていることに加えるようにプロセスを改善するほうが、はるかに良い時間の使い方です。\nページをより早く仕上げる方法を学ぶよりも、はるかに良い時間の使い方なのです。\n\nもちろん、あなたは次のように考えているでしょう：「ああ、そうか。\nアイデアを得るために読んでいるのであって、インクの量を見ているわけじゃない」と思うでしょう。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"阅读速度并不重要，从书中获取思想才是最重要的。","the_new_excerpt":"简而言之：改进你的工作流程，使你从书中所学到的东西加入到你已经知道的东西中去。\n的内容，远比试图学习如何更快地完成一页书更能利用你的时间。\n更快地完成一个页面。\n\n当然，你会想，\"是啊，不骗你，我知道我是在阅读中获得灵感，我不是在看书。\n思想，我不是在看墨水......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"閱讀速度並不重要，從書中獲取思想纔是最重要的。","the_new_excerpt":"簡而言之：改進你的工作流程，使你從書中所學到的東西加入到你已經知道的東西中去。\n的內容，遠比試圖學習如何更快地完成一頁書更能利用你的時間。\n更快地完成一個頁面。\n\n當然，你會想，\"是啊，不騙你，我知道我是在閱讀中獲得靈感，我不是在看書。\n思想，我不是在看墨水......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pkugge","excerpt":"These are books I really enjoyed over the last couple of years.
