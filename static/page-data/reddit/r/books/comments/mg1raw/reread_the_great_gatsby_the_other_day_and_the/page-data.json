I did some academic reading recently about the cultural amnesia of the 1918 influenza pandemic, because (along with WW1 of course) it was this staggering global trauma, but it undoubtedly contributed to the glorious, dangerous hedonism explored in Gatsby. </p>\n\n<p>Between the traumatised hedonism and rampant socio-economic inequality that, imo, form the axes of the Great Gatsby, I honestly think the collective experience of the last year(s) lends a whole new dimension to reading this classic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mg1raw/reread_the_great_gatsby_the_other_day_and_the/","title":"Re-read The Great Gatsby the other day and the last year has completely changed how I read it","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T02:17:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 02:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6e506799-0925-5569-9543-69b73309ab67","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mg1raw/reread_the_great_gatsby_the_other_day_and_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mg1raw/reread_the_great_gatsby_the_other_day_and_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"WalrusInSocks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WalrusInSocks","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"WalrusInSocks","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"前几天重读了《了不起的盖茨比》，过去一年完全改变了我的阅读方式。","the_new_excerpt":"所以和地球上的其他人一样，我在学校里学习了《了不起的盖茨比》。I\n很喜欢，后来又读了几遍。我一直有一个很\n欣赏菲茨杰拉德在故事中传达民族情绪的技巧，但...。\n我最近的重读是一种全新的体验。\n\n之间的相似之处...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"前幾天重讀了《了不起的蓋茨比》，過去一年完全改變了我的閱讀方式。","the_new_excerpt":"所以和地球上的其他人一樣，我在學校裏學習了《了不起的蓋茨比》。I\n很喜歡，後來又讀了幾遍。我一直有一個很\n欣賞菲茨傑拉德在故事中傳達民族情緒的技巧，但...。\n我最近的重讀是一種全新的體驗。\n\n之間的相似之處...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d66b995d-365a-504a-9988-3279b23f784b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mfng3w/ebook_sales_rose_16_year_on_year_in_2020_to_their/","title":"e-book sales rose 16% year on year in 2020 to their biggest total yet, in a record year for book sales in general - from Nielsen Book Research's Books & Consumers Survey","date":"March 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"电子书销量在2020年同比增长16%，达到了迄今为止的最大总量，创下了图书销售的总体记录--来自尼尔森图书研究公司的《图书与消费者调查》。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"電子書銷量在2020年同比增長16%，達到了迄今爲止的最大總量，創下了圖書銷售的總體記錄--來自尼爾森圖書研究公司的《圖書與消費者調查》。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3be36421-125d-5093-9093-0a03082c95d0","excerpt":"Almost exactly like it.","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/mfx3sa/i_just_really_loved_howls_moving_castle_and_would/","title":"I just really loved Howl’s moving castle and would love something just like it.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我真的很喜欢《哈尔的移动城堡》，也很喜欢这样的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"几乎和它一模一样。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我真的很喜歡《哈爾的移動城堡》，也很喜歡這樣的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"幾乎和它一模一樣。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-6e506799-0925-5569-9543-69b73309ab67","previousId":"RedditPost-d66b995d-365a-504a-9988-3279b23f784b","nextId":"RedditPost-3be36421-125d-5093-9093-0a03082c95d0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/mg1raw/reread_the_great_gatsby_the_other_day_and_the/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
