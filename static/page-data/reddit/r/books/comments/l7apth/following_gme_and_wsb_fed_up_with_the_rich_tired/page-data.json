It might give you hope. It might resonate with the resentment you already feel. It might give you a framework to understand or explain your reaction to what we&#39;ve seen in the United States in the recent past. You might find Grapes full of shocking double standards, where the rich get a different set of rules (read: the rich have fewer rules). You might be stunned at how a novel from 80 years ago accurately describes what we still see today.</p>\n\n<p>Get radicalized with me, and read The Grapes of Wrath.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l7apth/following_gme_and_wsb_fed_up_with_the_rich_tired/","title":"Following GME and WSB?
