And being forced to read was excruciating. And when I did read, I had a lot of difficulty comprehending what was being read. It would take me forever to finish a book because I would lose attention too frequently and have to reread passages.</p>\n\n<p>I’m currently going through a traumatic breakup among other major life changes and always told myself that when I have more free time to try reading again. </p>\n\n<p>I moved to a new place - alone for the first time in a long time and I had trouble being alone with my thoughts and being terrified (still am but less so) with moments of silence of having my thoughts race around in my head.</p>\n\n<p>I filled that time with reading. And maybe perhaps it’s because I’m still in such a profound emotional and vulnerable state that anything can elicit great mood changes but the past two books I’ve read really resonated me and have sparked some sort of rediscovery that I feel has changed my core personality to be a better person and understanding my self worth and my faults.</p>\n\n<p>I now look forward to reading. I can actually laugh and cry and feel emotion through words! I CAN FINALLY SAY “THE BOOK WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE”</p>\n\n<p>I even decided to get rid of my tv and I now spend a lot of my time reading instead.</p>\n\n<p>I bought a nice bookshelf and I am so excited to start filling it up with books I’ve read, and it serving as a visual aid in all the journeys I’ve gone through these books and the stories I can share with other people.</p>\n\n<p>The two books that changed my life:\n1. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - was hard to get into at first but I really like the style of writing specifically the authors Prose. \n2. Tuesdays with Morrie. - very uplifting and really made me think my outlook on certain things.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pd2g8k/wow_reading_is_actually_fun_and_it_saved_my_life/","title":"Wow.
