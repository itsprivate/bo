This is mostly it&#39;s because it&#39;s always so <em>perfect</em>. Even if it&#39;s the first encounter between teen virgins, they always feel each other&#39;s bodies <em>perfectly</em>, they&#39;re so in <em>synchrony</em>, every touch <em>has</em> to send a thousand electric volts through their flesh (and they use &quot;flesh&quot; a lot). There&#39;s never any awkwardness for first encounters. The woman always orgasms extremely vociferously, and the man always knows exactly what to do to get her to that state, and they <em>always</em> climax together. Every damn time.</p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s always described so prettily. &quot;She was hot and smooth, my knife to her butter.&quot; Yes, that&#39;s an exact quote. Other popular terms I&#39;ve seen are rhythm, stirring of souls, something to with stars or heaven moving, silkiness, being as one, you get the idea. And it&#39;s like...sure it&#39;s nice, but seriously? It&#39;s not pretty or poetic. It&#39;s a rather messy and sweaty activity, but somehow, <em>no one</em> ever talks about the smells or stickiness. No, they always taste like cucumbers or cherries or honey and they smell absolutely wonderful. I&#39;m not saying sex scenes in book should go into all the detail about the mess, but the ones I&#39;ve read try and make it sound so pretty and <em>clean</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You can probably tell this really annoys me. I get that you&#39;d want to sound nice and language-y, but this is just setting up unrealistic expectations and standards, especially for first encounters. It&#39;s such a minor thing compared to everything else that could be wrong with a novel, but it always breaks suspension of disbelief for me and makes me roll my eyes all the way to the back of my skull.</p>\n\n<p>Why, no, I <em>don&#39;t</em> like romance novels or even romance subplots unless they actively contribute to the story and aren&#39;t just excuses to shove in sweaty descriptions of perfect milk-white breasts and huge...bratwursts.</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add: I&#39;m not saying these scenes are in every book I read. I&#39;m not going out of my way to read romance novels. I read across the board, fantasy, non-genre, historical fiction, sci-fi, mystery, nonfiction (though I guess this category isn&#39;t really applicable), etc. What I&#39;m saying is that <em>when they show up</em>, if they&#39;re included at all, they&#39;re disruptive to my immersion. I&#39;m talking specifically about when a story&#39;s been great and intrigue-y up until that point, and then it takes a two-page long break in action to talk about bodily fluids. And it&#39;s not as if I can filter out these books, either, because how are you supposed to know that it has over-described sex scenes unless you read it? The sex scenes alone aren&#39;t typically enough to turn me off a book completely. They&#39;re just really annoying.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oxvywb/i_hate_sex_scenes/","title":"I hate sex scenes","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-04T17:48:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-04 17:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f75781c7-2c2d-558e-a591-62a3888b1f98","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oxvywb/i_hate_sex_scenes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oxvywb/i_hate_sex_scenes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Inquisitor_DK","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inquisitor_DK","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Inquisitor_DK","score":1440,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"セックスシーンが苦手","the_new_excerpt":"タイトルにあるように、私は小説の中のセックスシーンが嫌いです。これは、ほとんどの場合、いつも完璧だからだと思います。\nいつも完璧だからです。たとえそれが10代の処女の最初の出会いであっても、彼らはいつも完璧にお互いの体を感じている。\n互いの体を完璧に感じ、シンクロしていて、一触即発。\n1000ボルトの電流が流れるような...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我讨厌性爱场面","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所说，我讨厌小说中的性爱场景。这主要是由于它是\n总是那么完美。即使是青少年处女之间的第一次接触，他们也\n他们总是能完美地感受到对方的身体，他们是如此的同步，每一次触摸\n都会给他们的肉体带来一千伏的电压......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我討厭性愛場面","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所說，我討厭小說中的性愛場景。這主要是由於它是\n總是那麼完美。即使是青少年處女之間的第一次接觸，他們也\n他們總是能完美地感受到對方的身體，他們是如此的同步，每一次觸摸\n都會給他們的肉體帶來一千伏的電壓......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3f3ab8b5-ec89-582c-8ea9-0f25cdd7b03c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oxvy6b/mel_brooks_wrote_a_memoir_at_95_all_about_my/","title":"Mel Brooks Wrote a Memoir at 95: \"All about my remarkable life\" is out November 30","date":"August 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"メル・ブルックス、95歳で回顧録を執筆：「私の驚くべき人生のすべて」が11月30日発売","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"梅尔-布鲁克斯95岁时写了一本回忆录：\"关于我非凡的一生 \"11月30日出版","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"梅爾-布魯克斯95歲時寫了一本回憶錄：\"關於我非凡的一生 \"11月30日出版","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b3e33a63-e5b8-51c7-a845-a37ed7e405ae","excerpt":"I really want to read it and see what the hype’s all about but I’m scared I\nwon’t get any Greek references cos I haven’t read any BUT would really love to\nget into.
