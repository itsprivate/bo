Back in the 90s, my dad (a divorcée) and my mum (who never intended to get married) was introduced to each other via a string of connection because people love to meddle. On their 2nd meeting, they decided to get married. Both of my parents told me they decided the other person was &quot;the one&quot; because they have both read a Chinese book called &quot;Cultural Sojourn&quot; (文化苦旅) by the then-unknown writer Yu Qiuyu (余秋雨). After more than 20 years they are still happily married (and gave birth to and raised me in the process). </p>\n\n<p>There is a Chinese proverb that goes like this: in books there are golden houses; in books there are beauties with faces like jade (书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉. Some people nowadays use it sarcastically. Although my parents didn&#39;t get a golden house or someone with extraordinary beauty, they found their compatible partner and built a little family with each other thanks to their mutual love for a niche book (it is now very popular in China but back then it was very niche). </p>\n\n<p>There really isn&#39;t a purpose to this post. Just thought it&#39;s cute and I&#39;m procrastinating going to bed. BTW this is a really great book. Unfortunately last I checked there isn&#39;t an English translation, but maybe someone in this sub can make one happen, who knows.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nxthqj/my_parents_love_story/","title":"My parents' love story","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"June 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-12T02:43:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-12 02:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"756e6cdc-89f7-5bea-a9fa-6d8853d14327","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nxthqj/my_parents_love_story/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nxthqj/my_parents_love_story/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Anya_Mathilde","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anya_Mathilde","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Anya_Mathilde","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の両親のラブストーリー","the_new_excerpt":"文学がなければ、私は生まれてこなかった。ブックベイビー」ってあるんですか？だって\nそうでなければなりません。90年代に、私の父（バツイチ）と母（結婚するつもりはなかった）は\n結婚するつもりはなかった）は、人はお節介が好きなので、一連のつながりでお互いに紹介されました。\n人はお節介が好きだからね。2回目の出会いで、彼らは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我父母的爱情故事","the_new_excerpt":"没有文学，我就不会出生。\"书宝宝 \"是个东西吗？因为\n它应该是的。早在90年代，我的父亲（一个离婚者）和我的母亲（从未打算结婚）通过一连串的联系认识了对方。\n她从未打算结婚）是通过一连串的联系介绍给对方的。\n因为人们喜欢插手。在他们第二次见面时，他们决定...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我父母的愛情故事","the_new_excerpt":"沒有文學，我就不會出生。\"書寶寶 \"是個東西嗎？因爲\n它應該是的。早在90年代，我的父親（一個離婚者）和我的母親（從未打算結婚）通過一連串的聯繫認識了對方。\n她從未打算結婚）是通過一連串的聯繫介紹給對方的。\n因爲人們喜歡插手。在他們第二次見面時，他們決定...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bb11561b-8091-540f-aa53-515c528169b3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nxnpmx/louise_erdrichs_the_night_watchman_wins_pulitzer/","title":"Louise Erdrich's 'The Night Watchman' wins Pulitzer Prize for fiction","date":"June 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ルイーズ・エンドリッチの「The Night Watchman」がピュリッツァー賞（小説部門）を受賞","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"路易斯-埃尔德里奇的《守夜人》获得普利策小说奖","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"路易斯-埃爾德里奇的《守夜人》獲得普利策小說獎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-66ce69a8-1949-580d-85d6-db0530a2e3ed","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/nxu579/the_shadow_was_pulp_fictions_original_pop_culture/","title":"The Shadow Was Pulp Fiction’s Original Pop Culture Phenomenon.
