I hate it here and am currently looking for a job to support myself and move the heck out. I came home around the time of Thanksgiving and felt like I was reliving my childhood trauma being here. I slowly but surely spiraled into a horrible mental state and with no hope of this pandemic ending I was struggling to find hope, happiness, and positivity. After being so busy in college and making excuses for not reading, I made it a goal this year to read two books per month. So far I have read five and it has enriched my life in ways I didn’t think possible. I wake up excited to read. I work PT at Whole Foods and on my days off all I want to do is read more. Reading has given my life a new light and purpose I have been struggling to find, but I am so glad I did.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l7eioy/reading_has_saved_my_life/","title":"Reading has saved my life","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-29T03:05:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-29 03:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3f330400-3110-5035-9200-30af2d078856","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l7eioy/reading_has_saved_my_life/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l7eioy/reading_has_saved_my_life/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"lemonm11","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonm11","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lemonm11","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"读书救了我的命","the_new_excerpt":"关于我的一点背景。我是一个21F的，刚毕业一个学期的大学生\n2020年12月上旬，我和我的情感虐待者被困在家里。\n父母。我讨厌这里，目前正在找一份工作来养活自己和。\n搬出去 我回到家的时候...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讀書救了我的命","the_new_excerpt":"關於我的一點背景。我是一個21F的，剛畢業一個學期的大學生\n2020年12月上旬，我和我的情感虐待者被困在家裏。\n父母。我討厭這裏，目前正在找一份工作來養活自己和。\n搬出去 我回到家的時候...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-89bcf4bd-1de4-5673-97c2-9b2e4d294759","excerpt":"I didn't pick up on hardly any of this when I read this one back in school, but\nreading it now, in the middle of (gestures at everything) this— it hits\ndifferent.
