in my class we’ve discussed some very weird/fascinating symbolic stuff like Eumaus being the mirrored version or counterpart of Odysseus, also Odysseus being Hermes himself (this was concluded from the scene when his dog, Argus recognizes Odysseus and dies; Hermes is known as the ‘killer of Argus’ and Odysseus ends up being the ‘killer of Argus [the dog]” as well). the maniacal descent of Telemachus, who at some point, can’t stop brutally killing the suitors. and much more haha. </p>\n\n<p>გაუმარჯოს ლიბრის</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oll92u/odysseus_fought_twice_in_the_trojan_war_once_on/","title":"Odysseus fought twice in the Trojan war - once on the actual battlefield, once in his own home of Ithaca","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"July 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-17T03:35:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-17 03:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c11e27c8-0f5f-564a-9fb7-a9c5e232bbe1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oll92u/odysseus_fought_twice_in_the_trojan_war_once_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oll92u/odysseus_fought_twice_in_the_trojan_war_once_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"maydaying","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/maydaying","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"maydaying","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"オデュッセウスは、トロイア戦争で2度戦いました。1度は実際の戦場で、1度は自分の故郷イサカで。","the_new_excerpt":"私はネイティブではないので、このタイトルをつけるのにとても苦労しました。\n笑）。私の考えをもう少しうまく説明してみましょう。\n\n私は今、オデッセイを分析する文学の授業を受けていますが、私はこのオデッセイに圧倒されました。\nこのクラスを取る前に最初に読んだときに、どれほど多くのことを見逃していたかに気づかされました。\n(にもかかわらず...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"奥德修斯在特洛伊战争中打了两次仗--一次在真正的战场上，一次在他自己的家乡伊萨卡。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，作为一个非母语的人，我真的很难拟定这个标题。\n我试着把我的想法解释得好一点。\n\n我目前正在上文学课，我们对《奥德赛》进行剖析，我被吓了一跳，因为我第一次读它时错过了很多东西。\n我在上这门课之前第一次读这本书时错过了很多东西。\n(尽管...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"奧德修斯在特洛伊戰爭中打了兩次仗--一次在真正的戰場上，一次在他自己的家鄉伊薩卡。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，作爲一個非母語的人，我真的很難擬定這個標題。\n我試着把我的想法解釋得好一點。\n\n我目前正在上文學課，我們對《奧德賽》進行剖析，我被嚇了一跳，因爲我第一次讀它時錯過了很多東西。\n我在上這門課之前第一次讀這本書時錯過了很多東西。\n(儘管...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0e8d7a53-cbb3-5753-873b-b74b6b2f7401","excerpt":"I found out I might have cancer.
