He follows this with a look at how Weinstein wasn&#39;t an isolated case, but one of many offenders in an industry where men were abusing their power and using it to silence their victims with NDAs and payoffs. </p>\n\n<p>I thought I knew about the story, but there is so much more involved including ex-isreali agents, a large network of powerful figures at the NBC network that Ronan Farrow encounters, private companies that specialize in catching and killing sexual assault stories while silencing and intimidating victims, and even privately sold software that is used to track journalists, one of which was used to track and kill journalist Jamal Khashkoggi. Connections to Donald Trump and Jeffry Epstein are mentioned due to companies shared. I was only really curious on how much it actually cost and how many people are directly involved with these companies specializing in smear campaigns, sending intimidating threats, and etc.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was that there was a terrifying amount of power for a movie producer to have and the amount resources and connections to continue sexual assaulting women for decades.  I came away thinking how many more industry&#39;s continue these practices and how much more terrifying it must be for the victims who have no support even if you are a famous actress. The most recent story of the toxic culture at Activision Blizzard, makes me think how many more have been silenced.</p>\n\n<p>The most horrifying was when the victims shared their stories with their encounters with Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. The acts performed and the aftermath including what they could and couldn&#39;t do. You feel they were cornered and didn&#39;t have anything to help them, which forced them to take an NDA and a settlement. The Victims even after the NDA had their careers destroyed, intimidated and tracked, facing PTSD and mental health issues stemming from paranoia, victim blamed, and slut shamed. The victims are brave stepping forward and encouraging others for stepping forward to tell their story. I just wonder if the system, the internet, and the perpetrators will go to stop and dismiss the &quot;Me Too&quot; movement. </p>\n\n<p>As for the writing, it&#39;s nothing stylish as it is appropriately first person in Ronan&#39;s POV and the process of journalism is a lot of hard work, vetting, and source checking. At times you feel the paranoia and even the fears he had being watched and attempts to have the story dismiss by Matt Lauer, and even the heads of NBC. He does a good job keeping to the point and sharing his history with the subject matter including his sister&#39;s rape allegation against their father Woody Allen. I haven&#39;t read many investigative journalism books except Bad Blood and a few others. So I can&#39;t really compare that much whether it&#39;s extremely written. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you can handle the subject matter. It can deepen your perception on what &quot;rape culture&quot; is and how it continues to persevere, the conception of the &quot;Me Too&quot; movement, and how many end complying with predators whether they know it or it. I was left angry, saddened, and a little bit hopeful that victims are listened to and consequences are dispensed to the perpetrators. Unfortunately I&#39;m reminded that we had presidents, supreme court justices, politicians, and celebrities that run free and flourish without consequences.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m depressed and need to read a Star Wars book or something after this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/ovfwdb/catch_and_kill_by_ronan_farrow_i_thought_i_knew/","title":"\"Catch and Kill\" by Ronan Farrow.
