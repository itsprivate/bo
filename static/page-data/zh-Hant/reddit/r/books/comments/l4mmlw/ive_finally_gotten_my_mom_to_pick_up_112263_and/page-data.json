I had it on audiobook and went out of my way to drive, just to listen to it. I listened to it before I slept. I listened to it at work. I couldn’t get enough of it. I was enthralled- it made me gasp, tear up, and seriously just transported me into another time. It was amazing. </p>\n\n<p>Having decided that it’s likely one of, if not my all time favorite book, I tried to get my mom to read it. She’s not into horror at all, and has never read a King book. After months, she finally told me yesterday that she started it. She’s about 30 pages in and already has been absolutely sucked into the same world that I did. I’m nearly jealous of her getting to experience it for the first time!</p>\n\n<p>Side note: reading a bunch of other King novels first would be hugely beneficial to the story of 11/22/63, but is not necessary. One day I’ll get my mom to read It, and then have her revisit 11/22/63, and she’s understand all the tiny references that made me tear up and gasp with “missed connections”.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t read King, give him a shot! Horror comes in many forms, to the point that it sometimes isn’t even scary- it can truly be more about introspection.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/l4mmlw/ive_finally_gotten_my_mom_to_pick_up_112263_and/","title":"I’ve finally gotten my mom to pick up 11/22/63, and she’s riveted!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T05:05:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 05:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"976ee1b7-b6e8-5575-aca6-750da19301ff","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4mmlw/ive_finally_gotten_my_mom_to_pick_up_112263_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l4mmlw/ive_finally_gotten_my_mom_to_pick_up_112263_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"awp235","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/awp235","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"awp235","score":216,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我终于让我妈拿起了11/22/63，她铆足了劲!","the_new_excerpt":"我一直是个动作/冒险/科幻迷，从来没有探索过金，直到\n2020年下半年，我一直在翻阅他的书，并看到了。\n63年11月22日，把我吸了进去。我在有声读物上看到了它，并不顾一切地去\n驱动器，只是为了听它。我在睡觉前就听过了 I listened to it before I slept.
