&lt;p&gt;-Not like other girls (because they know how to read books or is capable of a clap back WOW)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Tragic backstory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Whole world hates them for no reason&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-abusive family, because of above trait, everyone is a jerk to them and poor them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Offhandedly mentioned that they&amp;#39;re actually very pretty, they don&amp;#39;t need to make an effort like other girls do though, it&amp;#39;s just that every guy (even though they hate her) agree that she&amp;#39;s pretty but she&amp;#39;s the only one who doesn&amp;#39;t know that (*GAGS*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me this is just lazy writing to add pity points, I get that authors want their characters to be liked and rooted for but still &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; and relatable, and these traits are just the easy way to do so. I&amp;#39;m not saying people with these issues don&amp;#39;t exist, I&amp;#39;m just so TIRED of reading about these girls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that these traits are all primarily in heroines in contrast to heroes, like a girl is only &amp;quot;heroine worthy&amp;quot; if they&amp;#39;re quirky and hated by the world. Or they&amp;#39;re only allowed to have mental-healthy issues because literally they&amp;#39;re cursed and whole world is downright comically vile to them on the daily. Where as there are plenty complex and well written heroes out there without a need for these traits to help their likability. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just my luck though, I can&amp;#39;t generalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I&amp;#39;ve seen other people who have answered to requests for &amp;quot;NOT not like other girls heroine&amp;quot; to mean heroines who are girly and feminine, but I don&amp;#39;t mind if the heroine is introvert/shy/tomboyish (or all those traits that make up a typical &amp;quot;not like other girls girl&amp;quot;), as long as the author doesn&amp;#39;t continually use this to wax poetry about how the heroine&amp;#39;s not like other girls or &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a breath of fresh air&amp;quot; purely because they possess these completely average traits seen in plenty other people of all genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They usually go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;LMAO, schools banning books? Kids will actually just seek out anything taboo, this is just free advertising!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t they understand the Streisand effect? This is guaranteed to just blow up as news and backfire on them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even at their best, comments like these are coping mechanism based on a just world fallacy, desperately wanting to believe that all will be well in the end, that human nature tends towards freedom, that censorship just simply &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t work&lt;/em&gt; at accomplishing it&amp;#39;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is... it obviously does work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can all look at dictatorships that successfully prop up the regime&amp;#39;s support rates, by denying negative information to their population. We can all look at school systems that provide more info on, for example, safe sex, will have will have measurably different outcomes in teenage sexual health.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the entire conceit of having a school system, is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it can influence what kind of next generation we are raising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even stepping away from the legal issue of censorship and free speech, to the realm of platforming, this applies. Big publishers &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; blacklist an author, stifle a genre, or promote a certain aesthetic style or even a political value. It happens all the time. Everyone who ever complained about &amp;quot;cancel culture&amp;quot;, deeply understands this. And of course so does anyone who advocated for boycotting or deplatforming something. (watch out, the two are sometimes the same people). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Streisand Effect&amp;quot; is not a scientifically proven pattern, it is an internet meme. Once under a blue moon, some really random incident goes viral, because someone screws up the optics of what book to burn, what book to legally ban, what book to blacklist, or even just what book to criticize, and gets an unintended effect. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can relax secure in the knowledge that this will always reliably happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on kamic justice to sort out what books people do and don&amp;#39;t get to access, leads to apathy at best, and at worst you are being led on by somebody whose interest it is for you not to worry too much about &lt;em&gt;a certain type of book&lt;/em&gt; getting banned, but still get worked up about their own favorite type of book facing the mildest possible forms of pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up reading everyday. At home, we have bookshelves in almost every room, all full with all sorts of litterature, english, french, arabic. The need to read is kind of engrained in me at this point. And groing up pre-crisis, I went through phases where I would buy up to eight books a month (which my mom thought was excessive, looking back, i do understand that), devour them all, mainly fantasy and YA books. As a hobbyist writer myself, the idea of &amp;quot;stealing&amp;quot; a book by downloading it online seemed scandalous. However, the recent economic recession kinda shifted my morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, honestly, I just dropped reading all together, I didnt see the point of saving three or four months to buy a book I would read in two weeks, I would rather spend my money on other hobbies, like art, even though, it is also expensive (I dropped art classes, and my desire to learn oil painting, going digital or some other pricey mediums) but I&amp;#39;m not gonna use up pencils and paints as as quickly as I&amp;#39;m gonna read a book. But with time, I started craving reading, creative hobbies take a lot more energy than passive ones, especially for someone with hectic schedules and struggling with mental health, and I got sick of spending 20k lebanese pounds on each pencil. I could reread old books; but taste shifts, I got bored of YA and fantasy, as much comfort as it brought me, growing out of things is inevitable. Yet, it still seemed nonsensical to spend a quarter of my mother&amp;#39;s income on a single book. So I caved, downloaded Sylvia Plath&amp;#39;s The Bell Jar, which moved me. And it didn&amp;#39;t seem wrong, how could a dead Sylvia care more about me not paying for her book than how much this book helped me understand and navigate the world a little better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I stuck to reading books by dead writers, Oscar Wilde, Charles Bukowski, Jane Austen, but eventually, my reading list got full of books by well alive writers, more relevant to the world right now, and it&amp;#39;s not like these books were getting any cheaper, of course, I still bought some of them, mainly the ones printed in lebanon, much cheaper, but less diverse room for choice. Same for libraries, cheaper, but I had trouble finding exactly what I wanted, and thrift stores not being available in my area, I gave in to the temptation and downloaded A Splendid Thousand Suns by Khaled Hosseini, which is probably one of my favourite books of the year, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to decide how I feel about pirating books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve often heard, &amp;quot;If you can afford a phone, a laptop, or an internet connection, you can afford a book&amp;quot; but this is ridiculous to me, in our current world, not having a phone or a laptop is not an option, 80% of my schooling is done online, more due to fuel prices than covid, I&amp;#39;m majoring in engineering, I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a good laptop, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have spend all my savings on one otherwise. Then, whatever money I have left, I spend on ubers to go to uni, because we do not have good public transport, and I don&amp;#39;t have the guts to ask my parents for more money to spend on books when they are partially paying for my expensive private university (the public education sector is screwed), my medication, food, clothing. I don&amp;#39;t really have a disposable income to spend on entertainment and leisure. And it&amp;#39;s probably similar for a lot of people above the poverty line in western countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it&amp;#39;s still not right, this is essentially stealing, not food, or clothing or a necessity, but stealing for leisure. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be different than shoplifting a book. Except it&amp;#39;s easier and doesn&amp;#39;t hold as much guilt, maybe cause it&amp;#39;s not physical and no employee or small business is getting directly harmed. Except the author and the publishing company. But do authors really care about people that do not have a dime to spare, let alone the equivalent of the minimum wage in the country, downloading their book from z library instead of paying for it ? Maybe it&amp;#39;s not that different from buying a thrifted copy, either way, they don&amp;#39;t get a cut. I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just being selfish. I hope someone enlightens me on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

I need to lead by example and I am here to solicit your help as I feel fully convicted that I am failing them in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for myself, having received by bachelor&amp;#39;s degree (major: psychology; minor: sociology) over 16 years ago and never using it, and getting 90% of the way through my masters (criminal justice) having never completed it, reading (really reading, books WITH PAPER)  seems to be a thing of the past for me. I&amp;#39;d love some inspiration, though I do already have a pile books to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my husband, having never completed his formal schooling, reading has never been on his radar. I would be in my glory for myself and my children to witness him enjoying and completing a book.  I don&amp;#39;t have a clue where to start with him. He&amp;#39;s a man&amp;#39;s man of Greek American heritage. He has a very tough exterior but was born with a heart to help and serve. A hard working man of integrity who has suffered many losses over the past 3 years (both parents, a brother, and 3 close friends). He became a dad later in life, 42 and we share 2 children (9 and 11 years old). He&amp;#39;ll be 53 this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give you this background in hopes it may help someone offer some insight on books that may speak to a man of his sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank anyone and everyone who can offer some insight. I would be truly grateful 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

I feel too many books give too much away these days in order to hook their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have read the book, I will post Audible&amp;#39;s blurb below in spoiler marks : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blurb Spoilers &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the Earth itself will perish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;Except that right now, he doesn&amp;#39;t know that. He can&amp;#39;t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;All he knows is that he&amp;#39;s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he&amp;#39;s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that&amp;#39;s been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it&amp;#39;s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts : &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;I can&amp;#39;t believe how much of the mystery they take out of the book with just these few lines! First off, finding out that he is on a suicide mission, even that he&amp;#39;s in a space ship is a gradual realization; one which makes you wonder if he could be on another planet somewhere instead of on an accelerating space ship. While I assumed he was on a space ship, having some doubt was exciting. Also I can&amp;#39;t believe they mentioned the unexpected ally. It is vague enough to not understand that it&amp;#39;s an alien, but the reveal is done so fantastically. Am I being too picky here? Figuring out all of these things at the slow pace the book feeds them to you was much more enjoyable than knowing even the slightest bit about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This was the first time I read a horror book and the first book I ever read by Stephen King. And I absolutely loved it. It is so well-written and even through there are just two characters and the story takes place in one location, something interesting is always happening. There were so many moments when I was literally on the edge of my seat and scared out of my mind. Some of those were when Annie squeezes the life out of the rat, the hobbling scene of course and when she kills the cop. These just sent my heart racing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie Wilkes is horrific and the way her actions, manners and thoughts are described, the way she keeps getting worse and worse gradually, it&amp;#39;s just brilliant. I thought that it was a really interesting choice to tell the readers the story of Annie&amp;#39;s past through Paul reading her Memory Lane book. It added to the horror and tension of the book and made it impossible to stop reading without getting to know the extent of Annie&amp;#39;s horrific past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so good. No book has made me feel how this one did and I am looking forward to reading more of Stephen King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P. S. The reference to the Overlook hotel was so smooth man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long story and a rabbit hole of frustration for you fine peeps will be an image in the comments I received when I tried to open my books several months ago.  I don’t mess with my devices and so such messages just seem bizarre.  I’m not sure what I did back then but I’m sure I did a lot of personal trouble shooting including removing devices and reinstalling.  When I exhausted myself I contacted Amazon Customer service both online chat then in person.  This was a long process of jumping through hoops and basically rolling out all possibilities (including what I did) and saying it was my fault for deleting the books.  I can guarantee I never did before seeing the image in the comments.  The image that prevents access to the books.  An image I see again which I have touched NOTHING with any of my devices nor added any new devices.  Nothing has changed except time itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I got the message for a very expensive scholar book and I have no reason to believe contacting them will come with any different result than last time.  That is unless some of you people have some insight you can give me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it would be great if you have insight to prevent these messages.  I sincerely have no idea why they are coming up.  If I am being treated normal then Kindle as business would drop off tremendously.  It is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drew Hayes is my current favorite for funny sci-fi/fantasy. He carries the torch of Pratchett with his diverse stories and humor woven into every book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Scalzi has fun and funny sci-fi with a lot of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon Sanderson has a few laughs even in his denser works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Lee Martinez is probably as silly as Pratchett and has a strong dose of the underdog in his heroes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of fun and funny books out there. But sometimes when I stare into the night sky I like to imagine riding along on the back of great a&amp;#39;tuin one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

A little bit of dramatization or creative filling-in of gaps in the historical record are permissible, but not when the author takes it up to an 11 and perpetuates sexist and historically reductionist narratives, all while repeatedly claiming the mantle of scholarly legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pity that all her novels are being popularized in adaptations (White Princess, Spanish Princess, etc.) that are somehow even worse.

I thought I scored a beautiful special edition when I saw the written name of the presumed first owner with the date 1928. Then turning the pages, I saw the frontispiece with a photograph from The Liebler Company cast, performing Oliver Twist in 1912. All throughout the book are charming black and white photographs of the cast from the play. This particular edition, as the publisher explained in the following page, was published because the play was so successful and because of Charles Dicken&amp;#39;s 100th birth anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiosity piqued, I tried to find the copyright page but found none. Thinking it was ripped off, I tried searching online and ended up reading the history of Grosset &amp;amp; Dunlap. Turns out, they used to re-bind books, turning paperbacks into hardcovers. They also pirated and reprinted books, causing confusion when people thought they bought first edition book but was actually reprinted or mistaking a first edition book for a reprint. D&amp;amp;G did print original books, with Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew as the most notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading this, I assumed that my copy of Oliver Twist is a re-bind and tried looking for the original imprint/publisher. But apparently, Grosset &amp;amp; Dunlap was also historically known for their photoplay editions, like a movie-tie in but with stills from the play or film. Very sought after by collectors. So my copy of Oliver Twist may not be pirated or a re-bind, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grosset &amp;amp; Dunlap&amp;#39;s history was a fascinating read. It also brought me new knowledge about books in general. Lately, my run-ins with pirated books are usually illegal e-books, or cheaply printed copies when trying to buy online. I&amp;#39;ve never had an ounce of thought about [the history of] book piracy beyond blurred PDFs passed around thru emails, download links found in NSFW Tumblr posts, and  the badly-kept secret book groups on the internet lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Grosset &amp;amp; Dunlap are now under Penguin Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking about books where the driving action kicks off with an issue that was known by the characters from the start, but which are only revealed to the readers at the end, usually at the climax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in &lt;em&gt;The God of Small Things&lt;/em&gt; by Arundhati Roy, the entire book deals with what happened to two siblings during their childhood to make to make one of them damaged as an adult. I absolutely loved that book, and it was amazing every page. I don&amp;#39;t remember being frustrated by the hidden knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I just started &lt;em&gt;Lake of the Woods&lt;/em&gt; by Tim O&amp;#39;Brien. This is not really a spoiler, since it happens in the first ten pages - the &amp;quot;plot&amp;quot; starts off when someone writes a hit piece that tanks the main character&amp;#39;s political ambitions. I&amp;#39;m about 60 pages in, and it is becoming more clear that the book is going to jump around the hit piece for the rest of the book, likely without revealing its contents until the end. It&amp;#39;s already making me frustrated because I just want to know. Maybe my patience has gotten worse since reading &lt;em&gt;The God of Small Things.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was just interested in seeing what others thought. It&amp;#39;s a framing device that I could see leading to reader frustration, as the only reason for the mystery is an intentional plot device by the author. There is no built in explanation for why the reader wouldn&amp;#39;t know it. But, in the right hands, it can be a wonderful framing device that sucks you in and makes you feel like you are learning a forbidden secret that the characters won&amp;#39;t even acknowledge to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes it even adds up quality to the original book, specially when it was written in far different written system and specific cultures. Translator notes can add quite a bit of context that sometimes can&amp;#39;t be expressed through the use of english that would be lost to some readers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes to mind good translations of Arabian Nights(the translations from multiple arabic sources, not the french one that was spread around here in south america). I can&amp;#39;t begin to imagine how life was around north africa and middle east in 2021, let alone hundreds of years ago. Context adds up so much value in such stories that it blows my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also with languages that deviates from mine (I speak tupi[a native south american language], portuguese and english) so much that a direct translation proves itself almost impossible. Japanese is a good exemple of translation that requires lots of context because of its framework, so I am always pleased to read the implication of the use of kanji in setences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, I&amp;#39;m just an indigenous Brazilian trying to learn about other cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr; we should value good translations and translators are MVPs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you haven&amp;#39;t read (insert any book, usually a classic (or even an author)) you&amp;#39;re not a real book fan!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you read (insert genre, usually YA or romance), you&amp;#39;re not a real fan of books)!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(Insert genre, again usually YA or romance) is BAD and if you read it, you&amp;#39;re not a real fan of reading!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It grinds me gears. Even while on my 5 year hiatus from reading, I saw it. Because it&amp;#39;s way too common. Now that I&amp;#39;m getting back into it, I just see it too often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually not stated as outright opinions, but reflected in insults or passive aggressiveness towards a genre/book/author and the people who read them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the moral here is to please try to understand that books are for everyone, it&amp;#39;s not your place or authority to decide who is a &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; or not. Just try to be less judgemental. But not just for books, for everything. Movies, games, food, careers, hobbies, fashion, etc. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt you if a 35yo is using this Reddit and all they read is dystopian YA. I promise you&amp;#39;ll sleep better at night not worrying about these kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m pasting this response to a comment I received. It&amp;#39;s in regards to my motivation to making this post and I think it&amp;#39;s relevant. I wish I had included this in the post to begin with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as saying it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;my issue&amp;quot;, I get what you&amp;#39;re saying, but that&amp;#39;s not why I made the post. My overall moral of the post of not being judgemental (not limited to books) is one I think is important. Because people hating that I like a certain book or movie or whatever? I couldn&amp;#39;t care less. But gatekeeping mentalities do make their way into power. Whether it&amp;#39;s political or a workplace or even a Reddit community. And it&amp;#39;s on those places where voices are silenced and people are hurt in very real ways. Encouraging people to be more open minded is something worth investing in, imo of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t live for other people. I couldn&amp;#39;t give less of a f*** what people think of how I dress, eat, live, read, game, etc. I do me, very unabashedly might I add. The reasons above are why I made the post. Not because I let myself be pushed and pulled by other&amp;#39;s onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the above quote perfectly summarises why 1984 is a classic. The book is a perfect blend between caricature and reality. When you start this book you think to yourself: &lt;em&gt;This is a dystopian future we will never experience. Things will never be&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;bad, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you read Goldstein&amp;#39;s book, however, things start making a lot more sense and dread starts filling the reader&amp;#39;s mind. &lt;em&gt;This sounds like a magnified version of what the XYZ government is doing to the masses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is where the genius of Orwell and 1984 lies; in the identification of the role of media and indoctrination in totalitarian control over the masses so early on into the introduction of media into the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I have always believed in is that for as long as civilisations exist, there &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; exist a medium, a tool, that will have the ability to control the minds of the masses. It is rather scary and at times (more often than not) this tool is used for bad rather than good, in a spread of misinformation rather than awareness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media will always be present, power will always reside with someone. The one thing we can do is understand the media and how the powerful make use of it to manipulate us.&lt;/p&gt;

This summer I read  &amp;quot;And then there were none&amp;quot; by Agatha Christie. It really captivated me, the writing was great and easy to follow. Some mystery books are really confusing and once you finish them you don&amp;#39;t really understand how the author solved the mystery without revisiting previous pages but this didn&amp;#39;t happen to me with this book. Since I&amp;#39;m a really indecisive reader, I can&amp;#39;t pick a book for the life of me and I love mystery books I decided to start a little challenge. I decided to read every Agatha Christie novel, I found a blog that recommended a specific order to read the books and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m following. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve read 7 books and I thought I&amp;#39;d share my thoughts about the books on here. I&amp;#39;ve always been a bit shy to share my opinions on different forms of media in case I missed some big point or didn&amp;#39;t understand something in the plot but I think this could be a great start. Also english is not my first language so excuse me if something is not clear enough or if my opinions are not perfectly articulated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve already read 5 books from the Hercule Poirot series I&amp;#39;m going to quickly sum up my thoughts on them in this post and from now on I&amp;#39;ll be writing an individual post for each book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mysterious Affair at Styles: 
I really enjoyed this one. I think it&amp;#39;s a great introduction to Poirot and Hastings and their dynamic together. Hercule unravels the mystery while Hastings guides you through it, trying to help his friend without, what it seems, much success. Though I enjoyed this book, I&amp;#39;m used to plot twists and thinking that nothing is what it seems in these kind of books so I kind of guessed who the murderer was before the big reveal but still it was worth the read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murder on the links: 
Now on the second book I&amp;#39;m already developing a love-annoyance relationship with Hastings. I don&amp;#39;t know if the whole point is making Poirot look even greater than he is or what but Hastings seems like the really dumb friend you add to spice up the main character. Still there are moments when I like him and think he makes the reading lighter. I liked this book less than the first one because of some questionable plot involving Hastings that made me mad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poirot Investigates: 
I adored this book. It&amp;#39;s a collection of Poirot cases, they&amp;#39;re not long but each of them is interesting in their own way. I loved the fact that I read a &amp;quot;short&amp;quot; story but it felt like I read a whole novel in 15-20 minutes. But oh Hastings... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Four: 
This is probably my least favorite so far. Though I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, especially if it involves an organization that&amp;#39;s trying to control the world, I found it way too surreal and fantastic. Hastings seems a bit smarter in this one (in some points, in other he&amp;#39;s the same old dumb Hastings) but he still doesn&amp;#39;t know nor follow Poirot&amp;#39;s methods. Don&amp;#39;t tell anyone but in my mind Poirot and Hastings are really good friends... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murder of Roger Ackroyd: 
Hastings left and doctor Sheppard takes his place. I started this book knowing there was a big plot twist and having read &amp;quot;And there were none&amp;quot; before this one I guessed who was guilty halfway through it. Still I wasn&amp;#39;t disappointed. Agatha Christie had the ability to give you the whole case, every detail (even maps of the houses!!!) and you&amp;#39;d still be reading without realizing the small mistake committed by the killer. When you finish this book and Poirot finally points out what YOU missed you can&amp;#39;t help but chuckle. I guess what&amp;#39;s missing is the magnificence of Poirot&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;grey cells&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general opinion, I like Poirot, he&amp;#39;s a realistic detective when it comes to his nature and though his lack of modesty might be a bit annoying sometimes I find it funny. Christie created a really unique and interesting character with him, I&amp;#39;d love to read a book where he&amp;#39;s the narrator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ll end up being annoying with these posts because there are A LOT of books to read but if anyone follows this journey and reads the reviews just know that you&amp;#39;re amazing I love you &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

My record was 10 pages in before I gave up because that particular author changed from past to present to past tense without warning, with no page breaks, and with the same character narrating everything, so time flow was super confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve read most of Jane Austen&amp;#39;s works and I think them absolutely brilliant (what a surprise, I know :D), so I&amp;#39;ve been looking for something similar. One of my favourite things about Jane Austen is that her books are undeniably romance novels, but still, they are not sex-obsessed. Austen remarks on the appearance of pretty much everybody, but they are aesthetic or factual remarks, not horny/overwhelmed with sexual attraction ones. I&amp;#39;m tired of horny people, and I am tired of reading about horny people. I have tried writers like Georgette Heyer and Julia Quinn but they did not quite hit the mark. But, I am definitely ready to try them again since I haven&amp;#39;t read all of their books (or gotten past the first few chapters) and there might be some of them which fit the bill. I&amp;#39;ve also checked out quite a few of goodreads/similiar recommended book lists, but most/all of the book covers have half-naked people, or the blurb/reviews have things like &amp;quot;instant sexual attraction&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a scandalous night led to...&amp;quot;, which uh, hasn&amp;#39;t convinced me to try those books out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up- set in the regency era, main focus is romance/romance is a very important factor in the story, there is no sex, there are no characters being overwhelmed with sexual attraction, characters do not constantly think about sex/have sex dreams/hump pillows while smelling handkerchiefs that the other gave them, there are no heaving bosoms or straining breeches, no one is unbearably horny, sex is not a component of romance. Preferably no sexual tension at all, but I&amp;#39;m fine with tasteful sexual tension, for example &amp;quot;his hand clasped hers during the dance, and while she had danced a hundred such dances in her life, and had had her hand clasped a hundred times, it was different with Mr. Such-and-such&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s it, that&amp;#39;s where it stops. It does not continue with a heaving bosom. Wow this ended up the longest summary ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; regency era romance, no sex, no one is horny!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

I couldn’t put it down and once I finished, had to sit with myself for a while to fully appreciate the beauty of what I just read. Never a dull page, incredibly written and I’m already wondering when I’ll read it again.

I am generally considered a smart person, however I have always had issues with reading comprehension. It is the same way for me when I am given an audiobook. I do not know what is going on most of the time. The only book that I somehow ever managed to make it through was House of Leaves bY Mark Z Danielewski, so I am capable of it, i am sure. I have no issues understanding and comprehending text in other situations, because I text my friends all the time and am able to understand them. I also write a lot and have written a short story of 40,000 words. However, even Harry Potter seems impossible and daunting to get through. I just do not understand what is happening, even with an audiobook. This issue seems to be affectIng me in other areas, especially schoolwork where I am learning subjects such as biology which are very text-heavy. If anyone has any ideas what Is going on in my brain, let me know. Or at least please give me leads to someone who might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just frustrating because I know people that can easily go through a book a day and it comes as naturally to them as simply writing. 
It would help me immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
