It was introduced as a real diary and true story, exactly the way it was marketed. When I started reading I noticed the scenarios were unrealistic so a quick google search led me to figuring out it was literary fraud and not even slightly real. I also figured out that many schools still assign this as reading material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only fraud but also very poorly written and poorly researched. The story is full of cliches and many of the main characters experiences with drugs are not even close to reality.
It angers me that people still assign this book as reading material, because it was obviously solely written to make money off off people who believed it was real and wanted their kids to stay away from drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are enough drug-related horror stories. Why read this garbage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m especially interested in learning more about race issues, and the experiences of people from other races. But feel free to recommend books dealing with other social issues, just please explain in the comments why you think this book could be informative to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

I made the mistake of looking at the &amp;#39;all time&amp;#39; upvoted list before doing this and saw my heroes like Gaiman, Weir, Sanderson, Atwood, Lawrence and Lois f**king Lowry (who I read as required reading in middle school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry. Again, imposter syndrome. Even though I&amp;#39;ve now completed my debut trilogy, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to ever go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo.... the Combat Codes was recently described as &amp;quot;an action-packed, bare-knuckle brawl that follows an orphan&amp;#39;s rags-to-riches story as he is tempered into a human weapon.&amp;quot; I promise you a real, live reviewer wrote that and it wasn&amp;#39;t my mom (who still refuses to read my books because there&amp;#39;s too much violence in them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pumped that CC seems to have hit the spot for many readers who dig martial arts movies. I&amp;#39;m a big fan of old school Bruce Lee and Jet Li movies, the Matrix and more recently the shows &amp;#39;Warrior&amp;#39; (HBO) and &amp;#39;Cobra Kai&amp;#39; (Netflix). I&amp;#39;ve even had some readers tell me that my books have gotten them back into practicing martial arts as adults, which is the coolest thing ever! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of writing, I teach Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (it&amp;#39;s like wrestling in pajamas), I have two (soon to be three) daughters and I love a good bánh mì sandwich (I&amp;#39;m half vietnamese).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very proud of the artwork for all three of my books, done by Felix Ortiz and Shawn King, in particular for the last of the series, Blacklight Born. You can probably tell the covers are heavily inspired by old-school Star Wars posters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/0VYxNhg&quot;&gt;Combat Codes Cover&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/AB57aio&quot;&gt;Grievar&amp;#39;s Blood Cover&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/nuu9OCt&quot;&gt;Blacklight Born Cover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Combat Codes made it as a finalist in Mark Lawrence&amp;#39;s SPFBO contest (best 10 of 300 books), which is pretty awesome, though by many of the judges standards it wasn&amp;#39;t considered to be fantasy because it has lo-fi tech and is light on the swords / sorcery aspect. I&amp;#39;m actually heavily inspired by jRPGS like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, where the tech and magic are intertwined seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, if you&amp;#39;re interested in a quick, fun, action-packed read, feel free to pick up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084GC1PRG&quot;&gt;first two books in the series for $0.99 each&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I&amp;#39;m also working on a cool new series with the folks over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wraithmarked.com/&quot;&gt;Wraithmarked Creative&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#39;The Rising Fist&amp;#39; which I describe as a Southeast Asian inspired &amp;quot;Gladiator meets Stormlight Archive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s about it. Again, I feel a bit like I&amp;#39;m wasting space here when you could very well be chatting with someone like &lt;a href=&quot;/u/MarkLawrence&quot;&gt;/u/MarkLawrence&lt;/a&gt; himself (who is one of my favorite authors and did an AMA  7 years ago.... yeesh.) But what the hell, while I&amp;#39;m here: AMA. &lt;/p&gt;

There are some great explanations in the comments. It seems most people don&amp;#39;t like this phrase because it is a cliche. Personally, even though it is a cliche, it gets the job done. And if an author can recreate the same feeling or visualization as this phrase in a more original way, then that&amp;#39;s great. But if not  this phrase is just fine, thank you very much. Original, creative, and engaging storytelling is important to me but I don&amp;#39;t think every single sentence needs to be original and creative for the writing as a whole to be effective. If an author has creative and original writing but there are some cliches sprinkled in here and there, I personally really don&amp;#39;t mind. I appreciate originality in writing as much as i appreciate straight to the point familiar wording i can relate to. The presence of cliches in the writing doesnt instantly detract from my enjoyment, and I think that is why I got annoyed when, from my perspective, it seemed like people were making it way too big a problem than it needed to be. But reading the comments i see that for many, the use of cliches is a sign of lazy writing and it makes it hard to be engaged with the story. Understandable. I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL POST:
Every booktuber and book reviewer i come across on the internet seems to have a personal grudge against this phrase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the big deal?? Yes, it is used often but I think holding a breath you didn&amp;#39;t realise you were holding is definitely something that has happened to most people in real life. I mean, it certainly happens to me so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s unrealistic for it to happen to characters in books. It accurately describes what can happen to someone after a tense event has passed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean what other way is an author supposed to convey the character ... literally releasing a breath they didnt realise they were holding??!! It&amp;#39;s like saying authors can no longer write that their characters &amp;quot;woke up and had breakfast&amp;quot; because authors are aLWaYs mAking thEir chAracTErs wAke uP aNd eAt brEakfAst and it&amp;#39;s GETting OLd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the phrase, &amp;quot;I could hardly keep my eyes open&amp;quot;. It is also a very commonly used phrase that authors use when a character is tired but I don&amp;#39;t see any booktubers or reviewers complaining that the line is overused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just get so tired of reading reviews that get so hung up on the one time the author used that phrase in their writing. EVERY SINGLE TIME I read a book that has this phrase, there will be at least one review going on a mini rant about the line being used in the book. Like, okay....it&amp;#39;s getting old now. You can stop freaking out about authors using this phrase, thank you. We get it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what, authors can no longer write things because phrases that describe something relatable and easy for a reader to visualize is too often used by other authors?&lt;/p&gt;

So I guess Im asking you all more experienced readers for some advice. I know Im looking for some good fantasy though, preferably High fantasy though I did enjoy Twilight (I know)....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a little context Ive always loved the standard fantasy in video games(Warhammer, Warcraft), Though Eragon wasnt a super good story plot wise, it had enough magic, cuteness and romance to keep me going. So I guess I got a weakness for the whole Fantasy action/romance. Ive also covered some Norse gods books in Norwegian. And Tolkien is Tolkien. :D However Ive had little success outside of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones was ok, a little too slow paced, but Tyrion and a few other charas made it worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books Ive disliked so far: Maze runner, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been looking myself for awhile with little success, so would be awesome to get some from someone a little familiar with books in the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

I posted on here over a month ago trying to find some good book podcast recommendations and you all did not disappoint! I wanted to share some of my favorites that I’ve been listening to and hear about your favorites too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marlon and Jake Read Dead People&lt;/strong&gt;—The booker prize award winning author Marlon James and his editor run this podcast. The second season started this week! They discuss classic books and have really engaging discussion and banter. If you’re a fan of literary fiction or classics check this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Shelf Reads&lt;/strong&gt;—This is a newer podcast that does a great job of balancing book reviews and discussion topics about various reading topics. They introduced me to A Fine Balance, which I’m currently enjoying! Their episodes feel varied—not just recommendation after recommendation. Very impressed so far. They seem to focus on lit fiction, historical fiction, sci-fi/fantasy, weird fiction, and some narrative non fiction and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookshop Interview&lt;/strong&gt;—This is a fun podcast to hear interviews from lesser known authors. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve heard so far. If you want insight on the writing process from authors, check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literary Friction&lt;/strong&gt;—Another podcast geared towards literary fiction but they do a great job of not making it a “thing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Book Review (NYT)&lt;/strong&gt;—A professional podcast that I listen to when they cover a book I am interested in. The Hamnet episode was great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book Riot&lt;/strong&gt;—another professional show that has great hosts covering publishing and book news. Love their inclusive/progressive focus.&lt;/p&gt;

It tells the story of a young American named David who lives aimlessly in Paris among the clientele of a local gay bar. David develops a general loathing of everyone and cannot seem to find his place in the world or find love. Baldwin makes it very clear that his protagonist is bisexual, but the homosexual themes of the plot are almost secondary to the way his characters navigate the Parisian cityscape as vulnerable, culturally ambivalent wanderers with too much time and not enough money. David struggles between his desire to place himself in heteronormative society, and his desire to be sexually fulfilled by men. He finds himself torn between his New World sincerity and the ironic distance of the Old World. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the book is definitely the strongest. Arguments are profound, but the quiet moments between the flareups also resonate with cinematic-like poetry. Characters grapple with their future, but the central dilemma of the novel continues to linger far beyond the novels&amp;#39; scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a fantastic read and I am very interested in reading more fiction by James Baldwin in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die,&amp;quot; but I didn&amp;#39;t really know anything about the plot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I believed every word about the supposed &amp;quot;abridgement.&amp;quot; I mean, I had never heard of a country called Florin or an author called Morgenstern, but I just figured there&amp;#39;s probably a lot of places and authors I&amp;#39;ve never heard of and went along with it. So I finished the book, which I enjoyed immensely, read the first chapter of the &amp;quot;sequel&amp;quot; and decided to Google it to see if King ever finished it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I realized. And I&amp;#39;ve never felt more gullible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me I&amp;#39;m not alone in being fooled because I&amp;#39;ve never felt quite so silly lol&lt;/p&gt;

The sides waging war being the idols we used to worship vs the idols we actually worship now. Maybe in an effort to save me from spoilers they never mentioned that the gods in question would be lesser known Gods. In my mind I thought that Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Chebbeniathan, and other prominent modern Gods would be the main characters warring against internet, and media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback by the inclusion of much older lesser known Gods. I loved the native American and ancient tribal God segments. I never imagined Odin would play such a focal point in a story like this. I was blown away by my inability to see that the United States that I know is only a few hundred years old. Being that most of it&amp;#39;s current citizens have relatively recent immigrated from somewhere else, the gods are foreign and far beyond my scope. So characters like Czernobog and Mr. Nancy were awesome. Midway through the book I accepted what I was reading and really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until the end where Gaiman addressed his omission of Jesus specifically. He said that it was because he didn&amp;#39;t write a prominent role for him, and that only lightly including such a larger than life character wouldn&amp;#39;t be the proper way to go about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious what the rest of you think about it. I know that often what we say to explain our actions often veils intentions that we not only keep from others, but ourselves. He seems to be someone with a clear history of some denomination of Jesus based worship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily seem to be the right word I&amp;#39;d use. But speaking as someone who formally used to partake in Christian and catholic worship, publicly representing Jesus in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t align with the Bible isn&amp;#39;t something I don&amp;#39;t mind seeing when tasteful. But it&amp;#39;s definitely not something I&amp;#39;d do publicly or professionally myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the bit that he wrote for him visiting shadow on the tree. That whole vigil for Odin as well as shadow himself ran some not so subtle parallel with the crucifixion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I thought the book was great, I&amp;#39;m sad to hear that the show had so many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

I would strongly recommend it if you want to feel like a kid again. It is somewhere in the middle of a kids fairy tale book, and an adult&amp;#39;s fiction novel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written by Eoin Colfer (I don&amp;#39;t know how to pronounce it either), Artemis Fowl is a series of 8 books about 12 year old named, well, Artemis Fowl. He is a genius, having the highest IQ in Europe, is a multi-millionaire, and is a criminal mastermind, running the Fowl corporate crime enterprise. He becomes fascinated with the existence of fairies when he is trying to raise funds to find his lost father, believed to be dead when his transport ship blew up in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the book. You will not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt as though some of the points being made during the trial were reasonable, but I felt that Camus’ intent was for me to root for Meursault in spite of his faults, but I feel like he was just obtuse and awful throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not going to be &amp;quot;Blood Meridian&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Giovanni&amp;#39;s Room&amp;quot; concerning how the story is centered. As a young reader myself, I can admit that I&amp;#39;m not extraordinarily fond of YA fiction. But it caters to a certain audience, so when I see adults reading it and then complaining about it feels odd since they weren&amp;#39;t the target audience to begin with. If it has an interesting premise, sells well, and the plot is exciting enough and doesn&amp;#39;t promote harmful behaviors, then I think it shouldn&amp;#39;t be compared to books that were obviously going to be more critically acclaimed because they were meant for adults, and for adults to analyze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course people can critique books, but I just feel like expecting more than your standard YA fiction with romance, action, and good vs evil is setting yourself up for disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

The story follows Bagoas, a eunuch gifted as a servant to Alexander the Great not long after his great victory over Darius of Persia.  Bagoas is a real historical person who gets only occasional mention in the records of Alexander’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a wonder.  The prose is accessible while also being lyrical and even poetic at times.  The scope is astounding, allowing the reader to see Alexander’s campaigns firsthand.  And Bagoas is a sensitive, thoughtful, and sympathetic figure amidst the cruelty and splendor of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portrait of Alexander himself is the real treat here though, in my opinion.  The book shows us a nuanced yet extraordinary character who is heroic, flawed, loving, and a visionary leader.  This is one of those stories in which knowing how it ends takes nothing away from the journey.  &lt;/p&gt;

Naturally, I went out and bought the book, but I also bought the idiot (I wanted to read it as a warm up to the author). Dostoevsky has an ability in creating characters that I’ve never seen any other author have. His characters are emotionally raw. Many of the characters in the book are rich, and the way that they are written feels hilarious, but also completely accurate in context. So much happens in the first part of this book alone, and what was mind blowing to me was that it happened in only one day. My favorite characters are the prince (who I relate to) and nastasya filipovna. The way that nastasya brings out the disbelief, anger, and hilarity of the rest of the cast was a great read. I’m excited to finish the book soon. Do you consider these two characters to be some of fyodor’s best? Who else if not?&lt;/p&gt;

But everyone just screamed &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; at me when I mentioned the name, so it sat in my mental book queue for a while. Go figure I decide to make it my goal for the year 2021 after the bizarre year that was 2020, super-flu and everything. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 1153 pages, this is the longest book I have ever finished. I figured I&amp;#39;d be able to knock out 100 pages each month, have it finished by the end of the year. Well, I guess things got rolling and plot arcs started spinning faster, and now I&amp;#39;m done with the whole thing twice as fast as I&amp;#39;d planned. I really did enjoy it, especially with the new series coming out recently and being able to watch that with a slight delay to avoid spoilers. (I have several thoughts on the mini-series, but I&amp;#39;ll focus on just the book here.) Bottom line here is: I&amp;#39;m so glad I didn&amp;#39;t let a bulky book scare me away from reading a thrilling story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first impression as I started reading was that King never really does many dramatic moments of horror or the literary equivalent of a jump-scare. His style is more insidious. Instead of spaced out moments that spike the drama, there&amp;#39;s a slow, sneaky build of... discomfort. I&amp;#39;m reading along and feeling just mild unease at what&amp;#39;s unfolding. There&amp;#39;s always something just on the periphery causing worry or tension or something, and not anything popping out and going, &amp;quot;BOO!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while to establish all of the characters and start weaving all of the different threads together, but once it took off, then it was on. I really appreciated the diversity of characters and their struggles. Maybe I will appreciate them even more on my next reading of it. And I really like when they start raising the question: now that we have a chance to start over and do things differently, &lt;em&gt;will we&lt;/em&gt;? I think it speaks to our constant NEED to evolve and break old patterns even when they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;tradition&amp;quot; or familiar or just hegemonic. There were tons of things I enjoyed about this, but these are the things that jumped out first. Oh - and Tom Cullen&amp;#39;s prayer on the way home. That is fuggin&amp;#39; gold, and I burst out laughing at first encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what now? I feel hungover now. Like I can&amp;#39;t even decide what to pull out of my massive literary queue to read next. How does anything follow THAT? I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ll probably have to veer toward something totally different to avoid any comparison, a biography or something. But again, I&amp;#39;m very glad I tackled this personal challenge and feel like I&amp;#39;ve joined many others of you that have gone on this same journey. I welcome your thoughts, memories, reflections or anything else related to your own reading of The Stand. Cheers, and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On different sites online you can now order something called &amp;quot;Blind date with a book&amp;quot;, with most options allowing you to choose a genre or point the seller in the direction of the kind of books you&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so happy to receive my little mystery book yesterday and even happier when I opened it up and saw the Blind Assassin. I&amp;#39;d never heard of it (Or Margaret Atwood for that matter) but I looked it up and saw that it was mostly met with positive reviews. The biggest thing I read was about her style of writing, but I was in no way prepared for the way this woman tears through your soul. So many chapters ending with quotes that leave my hair standing on end. I&amp;#39;m not sure whether it&amp;#39;s due to her being a poet, but I get goosebumps so often and I&amp;#39;m only 200 pages in. I cannot put this book down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think she describes mental health fantastically, without ever saying that&amp;#39;s what she&amp;#39;s doing. I knew after the first chapter that I&amp;#39;d be hooked when she ended it with &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Tell me where it hurts,&lt;/em&gt; she&amp;#39;d say. &lt;em&gt;Stop howling. Just calm down and show me where.&lt;/em&gt;
But some people can&amp;#39;t tell where it hurts. They can&amp;#39;t calm down. They can&amp;#39;t ever stop howling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t wait to of finished this book and be able to share my full thoughts on it. Truly the only book I have ever felt compelled to write and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t mind starting a series before its finished to support the author but at this point it basically seems he&amp;#39;s never going to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a bunch of my friends kept telling me it was worth to read even if he doesn&amp;#39;t finish. They said it was in their top 5 fantasy books so I finally caved in and read the first book.  Overall, I really wasn&amp;#39;t impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripes were:
1)  Having Kovthe tell the story. It kinda breaks any suspense of what will happen to him if we already know he&amp;#39;ll turn out basically fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  The prose itself was pretty good, he definitely has a way with words. But sometimes it almost felt arrogant, like he was trying to show off by his writing
 It took me out of the story sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Probably my biggest problem, Kovthe is just ridiculous. He is like the epitome of &amp;quot;....and then the entire room stood up and clapped for me&amp;quot;. Like that literally happens lol.  He is just the best at everything; youngest wizard ever, all the girls love him, super intelligent, greatest musician, literally talks about how he knows how to size up a horse and a town.  Its so stupid. There are no real challenges in his life. He talks about how &amp;quot;if this were a made up story things would have just worked out great, but they didnt&amp;quot; yet two chapters later he&amp;#39;s figured everything out and everyone clapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I could go on, but I&amp;#39;ll stop fow now.  I&amp;#39;ll probably read the second book just to shut my friends up, but overall, definitely not my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to books, I just adopted the reading habit last year, and read few books, and one thing that striking me is to pick that particular book and re-read it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the exact reason, maybe I wanna experience it again, maybe look at the whole story in another way, or I just don&amp;#39;t understand the way the author wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it might be, we re-read it because we think it&amp;#39;s a masterpiece and worth enough time to spend again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, these are books I re-read(some I read twice and some are once but I don&amp;#39;t mind reading them again because I consider them as a masterpiece):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stranger by Albert Camus - Short book, and at first I didn&amp;#39;t understand shit, done it twice and got the whole picture clearly (&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind reading it again&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surely You&amp;#39;re Joking Mr. Feynman by Himself - What can I say about this book, every chapter is just awesome and when I share these stories with my friends they all seem to be interested to listen to know more about Richard Feynman. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influence by Robert Cialdini - In the first chapter itself, it hooked me into the book, and everything he said in the book is just purely based on psychological experiments and they are interesting too (&lt;em&gt;Also happened to pick Pre-Suasion and read but this book is not just the level of Influence book&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start With Why by Simon Sinek - After his Ted Talk, I just inspired to pick the book and I read it and All I can say this is more than I imagined (&lt;em&gt;That time I was more into business and want to study companies so that I can build a good company so I re-read 2 times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originals By Adam Grant - Yes, the same as above, want to study how originals are made of and I just wanna study more in detail and know better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck by Mark Manson - Twice and I can&amp;#39;t say how much it impacted my life and also his entire blog is just awesome (&lt;em&gt;Models also a great book by him&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How To Fail At Almost Everything &amp;amp; Still Win Big by Scott Adams - No more words for this book, many of the self-help books took inspiration from this book because it just a masterpiece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Obstacle Is The Way By Ryan Holiday - I can say he&amp;#39;s the best stoic writer and he just brings Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus (&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#39;t easily comprehend these people&amp;#39;s work easily without the help of a dictionary&lt;/em&gt;) work in simple words and explains clearly with historical stories that happened in the past (&lt;em&gt;Also Ego Is the Enemy is also a great book IMO&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man&amp;#39;s Searching For Meaning by Viktor Frankl - You all already know why it&amp;#39;s a masterpiece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requiem For A Dream by  Hubert Selby - This doesn&amp;#39;t come under re-reading because I&amp;#39;m not that strong enough but I consider this is just a masterpiece. At first, my friend suggested me movie and also he said it was adopted from a novel, So I just picked the book and read it, I didn&amp;#39;t understand few things but overall I felt it&amp;#39;s fine and then, I watched the movie, it was more painful and I couldn&amp;#39;t recommend enough to any teenager to read this book or watch the movie at least (&lt;em&gt;Mostly Movie&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you may probably be thinking I&amp;#39;m an amateur because I mostly mentioned self-help books, yes I read around 40+ and mostly are self-help genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can list yours, so that people here will understand what are some great books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t hesitate if it&amp;#39;s fiction or biographies or even self-help, list out any kind of genre and the right people will find them as a great recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Students or teachers in academia these days: what did you think of the book&amp;#39;s portrayal of college campuses?  As some one who graduated college in 2007, I found the scenarios they detail quite disturbing.  They describe a culture of students who deem opposing ideas &amp;quot;harmful&amp;quot;, hunting out the ideologically impure and punishing them along with anyone who sides with them, which sounds a lot like Mao&amp;#39;s Cultural Revolution, which they also reference in the book.  Or Twitter come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Parents: What did you think of the book&amp;#39;s depictions child-rearing over the years: how now there is less free play and way more scheduled, adult-supervised activities.  Do you see or feel this difference?  I&amp;#39;m not a parent so I really wonder what it&amp;#39;s like raising kids these days.  Not easy, I&amp;#39;m sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Anyone and everyone else: any interesting points that I left out?  Any counterarguments to the book&amp;#39;s hypothesis?  Or agreements?  I&amp;#39;m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin has written 5 books in his 7 part series. His last release was also 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think happened to these men? Too much pressure? Lost the spark and passion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually surprised the publishing houses havent sued for breach of contract or hired ghost writers to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not one of those fans who insist they should write. I actually think its fine if they retire (although I will be sad) but the silence is very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys make of it?&lt;/p&gt;

One of my favorite books. Don’t know how many other guys love that book but I have no shame in saying that I love it. First off, Elizabeth Bennet is an incredibly awesome heroine and I have a hard time finding others who are like her. The characters are all well developed and some very humorous (looking at you Mr Collins). Personally (potwntial spoilers ahead) I find tremendous hilarity when a certain  someone make an attempt at a marriage proposal( a proprsal which should taught as an example of how &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; to make a proposal). The book also gives a great analysis or class/privalage and the sort during its era. I could go on for longer but I won&amp;#39;t to waste any more of anyones time.  I&amp;#39;d be happy to discuss more in PM&amp;#39;s though&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started studying History when I was 20 and read &amp;#39;Brave New World&amp;#39; as people kept on referring to it in my classes. I also now find reading to be a duty, even if it is at a snail&amp;#39;s pace. I feel like I owe it to myself to read, by our society&amp;#39;s standards, the best books ever written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

So this the first book since I started reading Remarque. And I&amp;#39;m very delighted of him. This book is forcing to think about what really means to be a soldier and would there is any honour at war? Once I thought about to become a soldier and even dreamed to work in the special forces maybe. But this book and changes in my mental health turn my minds of military in another way. I don&amp;#39;t have the wishes to become the soldier anymore. I want to be a medic. Remarque showed the war as it really is. No honour, no heroism, only lousy trenches and fear of death. Also I learnt some material about the World War I. There is an opinion that because Entente has superior in manpower, it could to lose more than Germany and its Allies. It really hard to realise that your Motherland don&amp;#39;t care about your personality. It only cares that you&amp;#39;re a soldier — manpower that can be spent for the most terrific purposes. And in general, World War I seemed more scary than World War II (even WWII has much more deaths). It breaks all values and foundations of the past. World before WWI and after is very different. If after WWII was the Cold War but people were really happy and enjoy the peace, so after WWI the humanity had the global pandemic, terrific economic crisis and rise of totalitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I wanted to pay attention to some shocking scenes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I really love how Remarque showed Kemmerich&amp;#39;s death. He is literally given a page, but how it affects on me. I almost cried. It&amp;#39;s the young boy who only ended a college and he died at war. He was very young and he died. His leg was cut off. Author make the emotional effect more stronger by telling the past of this guy. Masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Entire chapter when Paul came home on vacations. Remarque showed his returning very nice. Some time ago the main hero was under shelling, and now he&amp;#39;s enjoying his home and places of childhood. He even doesn&amp;#39;t trust what happens. He regrets he came home. And farewell with mother finally breaks my heart. It very familiar to me to be far away out of mother. Honestly, I cried at this scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Scene where Paul killed the French soldier. Oh my God. What a monologue. What reason to some German kill some French, really? And here I realised one thing. I&amp;#39;ve got how propaganda profitable to the Governments in war is. Only think about this. It&amp;#39;s really hard to kill another man thinking that he has a beloved wife kids. He can love, suffer and cry as you. So during the wars propaganda dehumanize the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) The pre final chapter. This one nicely showed how Germany was demoralized at the end of WWI. Poor and hungry they were retreating from their positions. And the deaths of all main heroes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually. I&amp;#39;d like to say that Remarque is the genius of his time. He&amp;#39;s one of the first who was talking about how war terrible is. He literally showed truly face of war. And now I totally get what for his books were under ban in the Nazi Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
