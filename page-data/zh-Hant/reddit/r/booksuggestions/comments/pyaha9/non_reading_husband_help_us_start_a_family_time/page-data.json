I need to lead by example and I am here to solicit your help as I feel fully convicted that I am failing them in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>As for myself, having received by bachelor&#39;s degree (major: psychology; minor: sociology) over 16 years ago and never using it, and getting 90% of the way through my masters (criminal justice) having never completed it, reading (really reading, books WITH PAPER)  seems to be a thing of the past for me. I&#39;d love some inspiration, though I do already have a pile books to start with.</p>\n\n<p>As for my husband, having never completed his formal schooling, reading has never been on his radar. I would be in my glory for myself and my children to witness him enjoying and completing a book.  I don&#39;t have a clue where to start with him. He&#39;s a man&#39;s man of Greek American heritage. He has a very tough exterior but was born with a heart to help and serve. A hard working man of integrity who has suffered many losses over the past 3 years (both parents, a brother, and 3 close friends). He became a dad later in life, 42 and we share 2 children (9 and 11 years old). He&#39;ll be 53 this year. </p>\n\n<p>I give you this background in hopes it may help someone offer some insight on books that may speak to a man of his sort.</p>\n\n<p>I thank anyone and everyone who can offer some insight. I would be truly grateful 🙏</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/pyaha9/non_reading_husband_help_us_start_a_family_time/","title":"Non Reading Husband: Help us start a family time reading habit","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T11:31:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 11:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pyaha9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/pyaha9/non_reading_husband_help_us_start_a_family_time/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/pyaha9/non_reading_husband_help_us_start_a_family_time/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"ScreenAmbitious7830","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ScreenAmbitious7830","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ScreenAmbitious7830","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"読書をしない夫：家族の時間に読書をする習慣をつけるために協力する","the_new_excerpt":"呆れたような気持ちで悩んでいました．\n\n私は祈りながら、時間をもっと効率的に使えるように努力してきました。\n祈りながら、時間を有効に使い、常にデバイスを手にしているのではなく、子供の前で本を読む時間を持てるように努力しています。\n祈りながら、時間を有効に使うようにしています。私が模範となる必要があるので、ここで皆さんに協力をお願いします。\n皆さんのご協力をお願いします...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"不读书的丈夫：帮助我们开始一个家庭时间的阅读习惯","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在与一种沮丧的感觉作斗争......。\n\n我一直在祈祷并努力提高我的时间效率，这样我就可以\n我一直在祈祷，并努力提高我的时间效率，以便我能够找到时间，坐在我的孩子面前看书，而不是一直拿着设备。\n而不是手里拿着一个设备。我需要以身作则，我在这里寻求你们的帮助。\n帮助，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不讀書的丈夫：幫助我們開始一個家庭時間的閱讀習慣","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在與一種沮喪的感覺作鬥爭......。\n\n我一直在祈禱並努力提高我的時間效率，這樣我就可以\n我一直在祈禱，並努力提高我的時間效率，以便我能夠找到時間，坐在我的孩子面前看書，而不是一直拿着設備。\n而不是手裏拿着一個設備。我需要以身作則，我在這裏尋求你們的幫助。\n幫助，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-py5epd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/py5epd/tennessee_parents_say_some_books_make_students/","title":"Tennessee parents say some books make students 'feel discomfort' because they're White.
