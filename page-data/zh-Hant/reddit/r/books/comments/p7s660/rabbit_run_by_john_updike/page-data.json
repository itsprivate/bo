I had been reading &quot;Moneyball&quot; by Michael Lewis, and at one point he mentioned that he wanted to write as well as John Updike. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing as how that book was about MLB, I got into my audible app, and chose the Updike title that had a basketball on the cover, foolishly assuming that I was on the trail of some kind of highschool basketball expostion. I thought at least it was sports-centric. </p>\n\n<p>I could not have been more incorrect. This book tore my heart out. </p>\n\n<p>Meet 26 year old Harry Angstrom, despicable fool, and protagonist of this emotional meat-grinder of an American novel. He is a former highschool basketball phenom, who grows up into a dead end job, a kid, and a young and intoxicated wife pregnant with the next. </p>\n\n<p>The story is essentially a morality tale that gets straight to the corruption, and inconstancy of the main character. He is a coward and a terrible father. Consumed in self interest and shallow regard for his wife, he just runs away... </p>\n\n<p>Without saying anything else about the plot, I just want to say how good of a writer John Updike is. He is the best American author in my opinion. Im American, live in CA, and i usually prefer English literature, but Updike might be the most naturally talented writer I have ever come across. His knowledge and expression of the human condition is unmatched. This book was perfect. It was perfectly concise. It&#39;s meaning was perfectly true and heartbreaking.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p7s660/rabbit_run_by_john_updike/","title":"\"Rabbit, Run\" by John Updike.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-20T13:41:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-20 13:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p7s660","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p7s660/rabbit_run_by_john_updike/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p7s660/rabbit_run_by_john_updike/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"jblesthree","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jblesthree","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jblesthree","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"Rabbit, Run\" by John Updike.","the_new_excerpt":"この本では、自分がどんなことをしているのか全くわかりませんでした。読んでいたのは\n「マイケル・ルイスの『マネーボール』を読んでいたのですが、ある時、彼はジョン・アップダイクのような文章を書きたいと言っていました。\nジョン・アップダイクのような文章を書きたいと言っていました。\n\nその本がMLBに関するものだったので、私はオーディブルのアプリを使って、バスケットボールが登場するアップダイクのタイトルを選びました。\nバスケットボールが出てくるアップダイクの作品を選びました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"约翰-厄普代克的 \"兔子，快跑\"。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道我对这本书有什么印象。我一直在读\n\"迈克尔-刘易斯的《钱球》，有一次他提到他想写得像约翰-厄普代克一样好。\n写得像约翰-厄普代克一样好。\n\n鉴于那本书是关于MLB的，我进入了我的听觉应用，并选择了\n厄普代克的书名，上面有一个篮球......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"約翰-厄普代克的 \"兔子，快跑\"。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道我對這本書有什麼印象。我一直在讀\n\"邁克爾-劉易斯的《錢球》，有一次他提到他想寫得像約翰-厄普代克一樣好。\n寫得像約翰-厄普代克一樣好。\n\n鑑於那本書是關於MLB的，我進入了我的聽覺應用，並選擇了\n厄普代克的書名，上面有一個籃球......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p7wngp","excerpt":"Reading first, watching second - YES PLEASE.
