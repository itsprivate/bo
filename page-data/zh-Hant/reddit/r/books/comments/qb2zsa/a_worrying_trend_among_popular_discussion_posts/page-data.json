The OP generally comes off as standoff-ish at best, and downright trolling at worst. This is compounded by them being argumentative in the comments, often alluding to commenters lack of intelligence for not wanting to engage the way they want. </p>\n\n<p>So, this is:</p>\n\n<h1>How (not) to start a decent discussion</h1>\n\n<h2><strong>1.  Don&#39;t make sweeping generalizations, especially about people</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Running the risk of breaking my own rule: people hate this shit. If you make these statements, odds are it&#39;ll just make people upset and they&#39;ll argue with those instead of discussing whatever the actual point the OP thinks they&#39;re making. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Instead:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Make observations, word them in a less inflammatory manner, <em>e.g.</em>, instead of &quot;everyone who likes this work is dumb&quot; you might say &quot;the work does not come off as intelligent or deep to me&quot;, this works even better with the inclusion of a qualifier such as &quot;... am I missing something?&quot;. This promotes real discussion, as instead of making people defend themselves, you open the door to having them explain their view. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>2. Don&#39;t make crass statements at all</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Moving past generalizations, it isn&#39;t positive for discussion for it to start with something along the lines of &quot;[something about this work] makes me thing the author is an asshole/dumb&quot;. I don&#39;t think I have to explain why this doesn&#39;t recieved positive attention. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Instead:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Just... Don&#39;t. You can discuss works without insulting anyone, even if you think they deserve it. Even if they do deserve it, discussion is best served by not letting those feelings make your writing and opinions more extreme than may be deserved. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>3. Don&#39;t be argumentative</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t start threads just to try to show how smart you are. If you&#39;re going to discuss, do so. If you&#39;re going to debate, do so. The second you start saying things about the other person, you&#39;ve entirely departed from these goals. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Instead:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Instead of attacking people for disagreeing or offering their opinion, engage with it. You might think everyone is a snowflake and needs thicker skin to not be offended by you just making your point, but in reality, it is you that needs to readjust your attitude. Don&#39;t make statements about the other person, even if you feel such &quot;observations&quot; are deserved. <em>E.g.</em>, don&#39;t say &quot;obviously you&#39;re not very well read if you think this is good&quot; instead maybe &quot;if you liked this work, try something along similar lines that I believe did this better&quot;. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>4. Remember that there is a face behind the screen</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Really, all of the above can be summarized as being kind and courteous in discussion. Try to be impartial, avoid <em>ad hominem</em> at all costs, and generally take on a neutral or positive tone. People respond in kind to how they are spoken to. If your original post is overly negative, it should not be surprising that commenters will respond in kind. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Really, all these things should be kept in mind by commenters as well, but it is very easy to just write the OP better, and therefore achieve better discussion. </p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you have anything to add! I might suggest that the mods allow reporting of OPs that are intentionally inflammatory. I try to report them when I see them for breaking the rule about discussion being the goal, but they are rarely removed despite little positive discussion occuring. </p>\n\n<p>I know that in general, big/default subs aren&#39;t good places for discussion, and I should look elsewhere, but I would really rather participate in change here. I also participate in <a href=\"/r/fantasy\">r/fantasy</a>, which is usually better for these things. </p>\n\n<p>I hope we can have a good discussion here, I&#39;ve attempted following my own rules but I am sure this comes off as slightly condescending, for which I apologize.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qb2zsa/a_worrying_trend_among_popular_discussion_posts/","title":"A worrying trend among popular discussion posts here","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-19T14:19:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-19 14:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qb2zsa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qb2zsa/a_worrying_trend_among_popular_discussion_posts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qb2zsa/a_worrying_trend_among_popular_discussion_posts/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"NotoriousHakk0r4chan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NotoriousHakk0r4chan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"NotoriousHakk0r4chan","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ここでは、人気のあるディスカッション・ポストに心配な傾向が見られます。","the_new_excerpt":"最近気づいたのですが、人が多く集まるカルマの低いスレッドでは、みんな「X」というタイトルで\n人気のあるX作品はゴミ」というタイトルで、OPは一般的にその作品のジャンルや人々について\nその作品のジャンルや、その作品を楽しんだ人たちなど、何でもかんでも大げさに一般化してしまう。\nその作品を楽しんだ人たち、そして彼らができることは何でもです。そのOP...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"这里流行的讨论帖子中有一个令人担忧的趋势","the_new_excerpt":"我最近注意到一些高流量的低业力主题，所有这些主题的标题都是 \"XXX\"。\n题目都是 \"X流行的作品是垃圾\"，而OP一般都是\n一般来说，OP会对作品的类型、喜欢它的人以及任何他们能做的事情做出巨大而全面的归纳。\n喜爱它的人，以及他们可以做的任何事情。OP...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這裏流行的討論帖子中有一個令人擔憂的趨勢","the_new_excerpt":"我最近注意到一些高流量的低業力主題，所有這些主題的標題都是 \"XXX\"。\n題目都是 \"X流行的作品是垃圾\"，而OP一般都是\n一般來說，OP會對作品的類型、喜歡它的人以及任何他們能做的事情做出巨大而全面的歸納。\n喜愛它的人，以及他們可以做的任何事情。OP...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qapocm","excerpt":"For years I've been neglecting various common areas of my life (health/self care\netc), and I know this isn't the subreddit for that stuff, but I hope this post\nabout my struggles with reading is okay, as I've recently been trying to\ncapitalize on these small moments when I want to make change.\n\nTo…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qapocm/i_want_to_try_reading_books_but_i_feel_like_i/","title":"I want to try reading books, but I feel like I lack the creativity and/or understanding","date":"October 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本を読んでみたいけど、創造力や理解力が足りない気がする。","the_new_excerpt":"何年もの間、私は自分の人生の様々な共通部分（健康/セルフケア\nなど）を怠ってきました。ここはそのようなことをするためのsubredditではないことはわかっていますが、この投稿が\n読書の苦手意識についての投稿でもいいと思います。\n私は最近、自分を変えたいと思う小さな瞬間を利用しようとしています。\n\nこの記事では","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我想尝试阅读书籍，但我觉得我缺乏创造力和/或理解力。","the_new_excerpt":"多年来，我一直忽视了我生活中的各种常见领域（健康/自我护理\n等），我知道这不是讨论这些东西的子版块，但我希望这个帖子\n但我希望这篇关于我在阅读方面的挣扎的帖子是可以的，因为我最近一直在努力\n因为我最近一直在努力利用这些小的时刻，当我想做出改变的时候。\n\n为了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想嘗試閱讀書籍，但我覺得我缺乏創造力和/或理解力。","the_new_excerpt":"多年來，我一直忽視了我生活中的各種常見領域（健康/自我護理\n等），我知道這不是討論這些東西的子版塊，但我希望這個帖子\n但我希望這篇關於我在閱讀方面的掙扎的帖子是可以的，因爲我最近一直在努力\n因爲我最近一直在努力利用這些小的時刻，當我想做出改變的時候。\n\n爲了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qbcdqv","excerpt":"Has anyone else read this one?
