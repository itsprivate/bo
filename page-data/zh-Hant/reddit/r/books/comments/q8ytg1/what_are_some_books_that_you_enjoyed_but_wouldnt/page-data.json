It follows two cousins who operate a trading ship for their family&#39;s business in the late 4th century BCE, starting about 12 years after the death of Alexander the Great and into the wars of his successors. </p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed the series because I&#39;m a crazy history buff, and liked seeing a really thorough approach to immersing the reader in the culture of a wildly different time and place than we usually see, with a high degree of historical accuracy. (The author has a PhD in Byzantine history.) </p>\n\n<p>However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to most people because the books are all basically travelogues; there&#39;s no real central plot or conflict to most of them, and in some ways it&#39;s like reading a novelized version of a game of The Oregon Trail. Day 38, sighted by pirates, chose to fight, managed to force them to flee. It&#39;s not that bad, but it&#39;s certainly not anything I&#39;d call suspenseful. </p>\n\n<p>So what are some books that you enjoyed, but you never get the chance to bring up in recommendation threads because they&#39;re too niche, too weird, too obscure, or just something that most people wouldn&#39;t bother to read?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q8ytg1/what_are_some_books_that_you_enjoyed_but_wouldnt/","title":"What are some books that you enjoyed, but wouldn't necessarily recommend to people?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-16T09:29:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-16 09:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q8ytg1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q8ytg1/what_are_some_books_that_you_enjoyed_but_wouldnt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q8ytg1/what_are_some_books_that_you_enjoyed_but_wouldnt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"twbrn","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/twbrn","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"twbrn","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"楽しかったけれど、必ずしも人には勧められないような本はありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"最近、ハリー・タートルトーブの \"Hellenic Traders \"シリーズを読んで、このテーマについて考えた。\nハリー・タートルトーブのシリーズです。このシリーズは、2人のいとこが貿易船を運営しています。\n紀元前4世紀後半、アレキサンダー大王の死から約12年後に、家業の貿易船を運航する2人の従兄弟を描いています。\n紀元前4世紀後半、アレキサンダー大王の死から約12年後、大王の戦争が始まった頃の話です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"有哪些书是你喜欢的，但不一定会推荐给别人的？","the_new_excerpt":"我开始思考这个问题，因为我最近读了哈里-特莱多夫的 \"希腊贸易者 \"系列。\n系列，作者是Harry Turtledove。该书讲述了两个表兄妹经营一艘贸易船\n在公元前4世纪晚期，他们为自己的家族生意经营一艘贸易船，大约在公元前4世纪晚期的12年开始\n在亚历山大大帝死后约12年开始，进入他的战争时期。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有哪些書是你喜歡的，但不一定會推薦給別人的？","the_new_excerpt":"我開始思考這個問題，因爲我最近讀了哈里-特萊多夫的 \"希臘貿易者 \"系列。\n系列，作者是Harry Turtledove。該書講述了兩個表兄妹經營一艘貿易船\n在公元前4世紀晚期，他們爲自己的家族生意經營一艘貿易船，大約在公元前4世紀晚期的12年開始\n在亞歷山大大帝死後約12年開始，進入他的戰爭時期。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q8oscl","excerpt":"or something similar to them But one single Novel (no series if possible)","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/q8oscl/dystopian_scifi_novels_like_do_androids_dream_of/","title":"Dystopian sci-fi Novels like \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" or \"Brave New World\"","date":"October 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep \"や \"Brave New World \"などのディストピアSF小説","the_new_excerpt":"またはそれに類するもの しかし、一つの小説（できればシリーズものではない）。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"歇斯底里的科幻小说，如 \"安卓人梦见电羊 \"或 \"勇敢的新世界\"。","the_new_excerpt":"或与之类似的东西，但要有一本小说（如果可能的话，没有系列）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"歇斯底里的科幻小說，如 \"安卓人夢見電羊 \"或 \"勇敢的新世界\"。","the_new_excerpt":"或與之類似的東西，但要有一本小說（如果可能的話，沒有系列）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q910hn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q910hn/netflix_is_starting_a_book_club/","title":"Netflix Is Starting a Book Club","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 16, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Netflixがブッククラブを開始","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Netflix将成立一个图书俱乐部","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Netflix將成立一個圖書俱樂部","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q8ytg1","previousId":"RedditPost-q8oscl","nextId":"RedditPost-q910hn","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q8ytg1/what_are_some_books_that_you_enjoyed_but_wouldnt/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
