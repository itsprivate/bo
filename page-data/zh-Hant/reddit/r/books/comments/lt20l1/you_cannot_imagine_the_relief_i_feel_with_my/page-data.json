Plenty of precautions and whatnot, but it was wonderful to be back in there. The 1st floor, however, is about 1/3 a kids/YA section and the majority of the rest is fiction and gifts. As fun as it is to browse their fiction books, including their legendary sci-fi section, what I really longed for was the non-fiction sections on the 2nd floor. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday Powell&#39;s announced their 2nd floor is opening up TODAY! It&#39;s a sense of relief and pure joy to be able to go back up there today.
