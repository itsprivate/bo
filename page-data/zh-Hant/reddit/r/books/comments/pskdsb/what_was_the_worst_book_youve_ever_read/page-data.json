I picked it up last year around October because I wanted to read something spooky, and it was the exact opposite. The writing was dull, boring, and the supposedly haunted house didn&#39;t even do anything scary. Oh, I forgot - it made two guys gay.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, you read that right. The mysterious haunted house turned two straight guys gay. The horror!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also filled with sexist, racist, and antisemetic remarks. At one point in the narration she mocks a character&#39;s last name for being Jewish, and two different characters call him a Nazi. Oh, and he&#39;s also an abusive husband who&#39;s stingy with money and beats his wife, who they make a point to say is NOT Jewish, as if that makes her better somehow.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the scariest part of that book was the author herself. 0 out of 10, would not recommend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pskdsb/what_was_the_worst_book_youve_ever_read/","title":"What was the worst book you've ever read?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T17:27:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 17:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pskdsb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pskdsb/what_was_the_worst_book_youve_ever_read/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pskdsb/what_was_the_worst_book_youve_ever_read/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"ChilledInk","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChilledInk","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChilledInk","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今まで読んだ本の中で一番ひどい本は？","the_new_excerpt":"私の場合は、Anne Rivers Siddonsの「The House Next Door」でした。去年の10月頃、何か不気味な本を読みたいと思って手に取った\n去年の10月頃、何か不気味な本を読みたいと思って手に取ったのですが、それとは正反対でした。\n正反対でした。文章は退屈でつまらないし、お化け屋敷と言われているのに何も怖くない。\n何も怖くなかった。ああ、忘れていた-それは二人の男を作った...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你读过的最糟糕的书是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"对我来说，是安妮-里弗斯-西登斯的《隔壁的房子》。我在去年十月左右拿起它\n因为我想读一些阴森恐怖的东西，而它恰恰相反。\n恰恰相反。写作枯燥无味，而且那个所谓的鬼屋\n甚至没有做任何可怕的事情。哦，我忘了--它让两个人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你讀過的最糟糕的書是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"對我來說，是安妮-裏弗斯-西登斯的《隔壁的房子》。我在去年十月左右拿起它\n因爲我想讀一些陰森恐怖的東西，而它恰恰相反。\n恰恰相反。寫作枯燥無味，而且那個所謂的鬼屋\n甚至沒有做任何可怕的事情。哦，我忘了--它讓兩個人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-psflfe","excerpt":"Hi guys, I’m looking for some new books to read.
