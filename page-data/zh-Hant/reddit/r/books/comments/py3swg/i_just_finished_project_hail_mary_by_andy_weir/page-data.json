I feel too many books give too much away these days in order to hook their viewers. </p>\n\n<p>For those who have read the book, I will post Audible&#39;s blurb below in spoiler marks : </p>\n\n<p>Blurb Spoilers <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the Earth itself will perish. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Except that right now, he doesn&#39;t know that. He can&#39;t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">All he knows is that he&#39;s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he&#39;s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that&#39;s been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it&#39;s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance </span></p>\n\n<p>My thoughts : <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">I can&#39;t believe how much of the mystery they take out of the book with just these few lines! First off, finding out that he is on a suicide mission, even that he&#39;s in a space ship is a gradual realization; one which makes you wonder if he could be on another planet somewhere instead of on an accelerating space ship. While I assumed he was on a space ship, having some doubt was exciting. Also I can&#39;t believe they mentioned the unexpected ally. It is vague enough to not understand that it&#39;s an alien, but the reveal is done so fantastically. Am I being too picky here? Figuring out all of these things at the slow pace the book feeds them to you was much more enjoyable than knowing even the slightest bit about it.</span></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/py3swg/i_just_finished_project_hail_mary_by_andy_weir/","title":"I just finished \"Project Hail Mary\" by Andy Weir going in completely blind.
