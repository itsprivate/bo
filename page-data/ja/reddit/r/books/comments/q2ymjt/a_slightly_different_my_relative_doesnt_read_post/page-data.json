Despite living quite a ways away from him and my Grandma, I always saw them multiple times a year for days at a time.</p>\n\n<p>I never saw my grampa read a book. I saw him use a thick magnifying glass to pore, slowly, over a newspaper, sure. But a full-fledged book? Not once. As I got older, and as he got older, I realized that I didn’t know him nearly as well as I wanted to. So I talked with family about him, talked with him about family, and, on the rare occasion that he was willing, talked with him about him.</p>\n\n<p>I learned that he had done a lot in his life. What he did in the military. How hard he worked to support his many children. What dreams he once had that, while he was perfectly happy with how life had gone, he still wondered about. How, upon receiving a lounge chair one birthday, he returned it because the family was poor and because, well, he never sat down, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Once, soon before he died, he asked about a book I was reading. It was a thick epic fantasy book, and he was a very practical man, so I tried my hardest to explain why reading this thing for the third time was something I thought worthwhile. After a short while, we talked about something else. In hindsight, I suspect he realized that I was uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>My Grandpa passed a few years back and I helped clean out his house. Cleaning out his packed office, I saw something that still surprises and pains me to this day. Right in the back of the room were two tall bookcases, both almost completely filled with a horde of books. It had that lack of organization that made it clear you cared more about reading the books than looking at them. Most were nonfiction, but many weren’t. On the top shelf, I found a small array or five or so books, all of them with some random bit of torn newspaper marking where he was. It looked as though they were all just waiting to get picked up and finished.</p>\n\n<p>But all those books were coated in a thick layer of dust, far more than would’ve accumulated since he had last been in that room. What had happened was obvious. He had read plenty in his retirement. Frankly, he probably read more steadily than I ever have. Then came the day when he was about to go over and choose which of the five he’d continue and instead thought, “I can’t bear to go as slowly as my bad eyes forced me to yesterday.” He had always gone over that newspaper so damn slowly, yet I had never realized that doing the same for a book would be torture, especially for a voracious reader.</p>\n\n<p>Those bookshelves are in my bedroom now.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re gonna take a lesson from this, I think there are a few. First, never assume someone doesn’t read just because you never see it or because they don’t seem like one. Maybe they’ve just never realized you’d like to know. Ask. Second, when sharing your interests with those who care about you, don’t distort it to make it palatable to them. They might find it genuinely interesting. At the very least, hearing a loved one gush about their passion is never unpleasant in moderation. Third, not everyone knows about/trusts the quality of audiobooks. Those who don’t tend to be older- the same people who often have worsening vision. Spread the word, if only just in case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q2ymjt/a_slightly_different_my_relative_doesnt_read_post/","title":"A slightly different “my relative doesn’t read” post","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-07T03:34:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-07 03:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q2ymjt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q2ymjt/a_slightly_different_my_relative_doesnt_read_post/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q2ymjt/a_slightly_different_my_relative_doesnt_read_post/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Reads_Sometimes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reads_Sometimes","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Reads_Sometimes","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ちょっと変わった「親戚が読まない」投稿","the_new_excerpt":"私は幸運なことに、子供の頃からずっとおじいちゃんを知っていました。おじいちゃんとおばあちゃんの家は\nおじいちゃんとおばあちゃんとはかなり離れたところに住んでいましたが、年に何度も何日も会っていました。\n一年に何度も何日も会っていました。\n\n私はおじいちゃんが本を読んでいるところを見たことがありません。分厚い虫眼鏡を使って、ゆっくりと新聞に目を通しているのを見ました。\n分厚い虫眼鏡を使って、ゆっくりと新聞を読んでいるのを見たことはあります。でも......。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个略有不同的 \"我的亲戚不读书 \"的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我很幸运，在我的整个童年时期都认识我的外公。尽管生活在\n尽管我住的地方离他和我奶奶很远，但我每年总能见到他们好几次。\n一年多次，每次都是好几天。\n\n我从未见过爷爷看书。我看到他用一个厚厚的放大镜来\n慢慢地翻阅一份报纸，当然。但是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個略有不同的 \"我的親戚不讀書 \"的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我很幸運，在我的整個童年時期都認識我的外公。儘管生活在\n儘管我住的地方離他和我奶奶很遠，但我每年總能見到他們好幾次。\n一年多次，每次都是好幾天。\n\n我從未見過爺爺看書。我看到他用一個厚厚的放大鏡來\n慢慢地翻閱一份報紙，當然。但是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q2xtif","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q2xtif/rick_riordans_next_camp_halfblood_book_will_focus/","title":"Rick Riordan's next Camp Half-Blood book will focus on Nico di Angelo and Will Solace","date":"October 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Rick Riordanの次回作「Camp Half-Blood」は、Nico di AngeloとWill Solaceに焦点を当てた作品になります。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"瑞克-瑞丹的下一本混血营书将关注尼科-迪-安杰洛和威尔-索拉斯","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"瑞克-瑞丹的下一本混血營書將關注尼科-迪-安傑洛和威爾-索拉斯","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q348pf","excerpt":"Hello!
