What I loved the most about the books (other than the story itself) was the magic system. It was almost scientific with all the rules carefully given to us throughout all the books. The epigraphs were a nice addition. Overall the series gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.</p>\n\n<h1>Book 1: The Final Empire</h1>\n\n<p>The Final Empire was definitely a good book as it draws you in with the detailed world and deep lore. Lots of action and adventure which I enjoy immensely. Kelsier was my favorite character in this book mainly because he was kind of morally ambiguous but still unquestionably a hero. The dialogue felt a little awkward and stilted at times but other than that I don&#39;t have any other complaints. (I really liked the concept of the Inquisitors and they get even better in the last book.) </p>\n\n<h1>Book 2: The Well of Ascension</h1>\n\n<p>I have mixed feelings about this one. We see Vin growing in power and some new interesting characters are introduced. Other side characters are also brought into focus, mainly Sazed. I thought that this book dragged a bit in the middle with all the politics and other stuff. It still had many impressive moments here and there. I would say the ending redeemed this book. What an explosive ending! I immediately picked up the third book &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t wait. Sazed was the best character in this book for me.</p>\n\n<h1>Book 3: The Hero of Ages</h1>\n\n<p>This is the best book in the trilogy. All loose ends are resolved. It blew my mind how even the most insignificant detail from book 1 fell into place. You could tell that Branderson had planned ahead and he wasn&#39;t just making things up on the go. The ending in this one was even more explosive. Although the 2 major characters died, it was still a satisfying end. My complaint is that I didn&#39;t really connect to the characters. It was confirmed when I didn&#39;t get as much of an emotional response I thought I would when Vin and Elend died. It was more like a general sadness than anything else. Needless to say, it was the plot that made me like this series more rather than the characters. But it was enjoyable anyways.</p>\n\n<p>I plan on reading Six of Crows next even though I haven&#39;t read the Grisha trilogy. People have told me you can do that with not many problems. </p>\n\n<p>What were your thoughts about this book series?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oyh1vo/the_mistborn_trilogy_by_brandon_sanderson/","title":"The Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-05T19:27:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-05 19:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"oyh1vo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oyh1vo/the_mistborn_trilogy_by_brandon_sanderson/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oyh1vo/the_mistborn_trilogy_by_brandon_sanderson/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"RudrakshDange","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RudrakshDange","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RudrakshDange","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブランドン・サンダーソンの「ミストボーン」3部作","the_new_excerpt":"最初の3部作を終えて、その結末に圧倒されました。ブランダーソンは\n伝説的なワールドビルダーです。私がこの本で最も気に入ったのは（物語そのもの以外に）、魔法のシステムです。\n物語以外で最も気に入ったのは、魔法のシステムでした。すべての本の中で丁寧にルールが示されていて、ほとんど科学的でした。\n丁寧に教えてくれます。エピグラフは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"布兰登-桑德森的 \"雾裔三部曲\"。","the_new_excerpt":"我完成了第一部三部曲，被结局所震撼。布兰德森是一位\n传说中的世界建设者。我最喜欢这些书的地方（除了故事本身之外）是魔法系统。\n故事本身）是魔法系统。它几乎是科学的，所有的规则\n所有的书都仔细地告诉了我们。题记...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"布蘭登-桑德森的 \"霧裔三部曲\"。","the_new_excerpt":"我完成了第一部三部曲，被結局所震撼。布蘭德森是一位\n傳說中的世界建設者。我最喜歡這些書的地方（除了故事本身之外）是魔法系統。\n故事本身）是魔法系統。它幾乎是科學的，所有的規則\n所有的書都仔細地告訴了我們。題記...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-oyfdcv","excerpt":"This was my first 900 page+ book and holy hell it felt like I was taken on a\njourney with the characters on each page of the book.\n\nIt was fascinating to witness the plot unravel, I felt great satisfaction with\nthe outcome of some of the events as a reader.\n\nEliot’s social commentary is sometimes so…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oyfdcv/just_finished_reading_middlemarch_by_george_eliot/","title":"Just finished reading Middlemarch by George Eliot","date":"August 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ジョージ・エリオットの「ミドルマーチ」を読み終えたところです。","the_new_excerpt":"この本は私にとって初めての900ページ以上の本でしたが、1ページ1ページの登場人物たちと一緒に旅をしているような気分になりました。\n本の各ページの登場人物たちと一緒に旅をしているような気分になりました。\n\nプロットが解き明かされていくのを目の当たりにするのは魅力的で、いくつかのアクションの結果に大きな満足感を覚えました。\n読者としては、いくつかの出来事の結果に大きな満足感を覚えました。\n\nエリオットの社会批評は、ときにとても...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"刚刚读完乔治-艾略特的《米德尔马奇》。","the_new_excerpt":"这是我的第一本900页以上的书，我的天哪，感觉就像被带进了一个迷宫。\n与书中每一页上的人物一起旅行。\n\n目睹情节的发展令人着迷，我对一些事件的结果感到非常满意。\n作为一个读者，我对一些事件的结果感到非常满意。\n\n艾略特的社会评论有时是如此......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛剛讀完喬治-艾略特的《米德爾馬奇》。","the_new_excerpt":"這是我的第一本900頁以上的書，我的天哪，感覺就像被帶進了一個迷宮。\n與書中每一頁上的人物一起旅行。\n\n目睹情節的發展令人着迷，我對一些事件的結果感到非常滿意。\n作爲一個讀者，我對一些事件的結果感到非常滿意。\n\n艾略特的社會評論有時是如此......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-oyi0od","excerpt":"I ask because this year is the first time I've attempted the 52 book challenge\nand I've found that because I'm tracking my reading, I'm paying closer attention\nto the backgrounds of the various authors whose work I'm engaging with.\n\nI recently reached 59 books (over-achieving!) and decided to go…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oyi0od/how_many_of_you_make_a_conscious_effort_to_read/","title":"How many of you make a conscious effort to read authors from diverse backgrounds?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 05, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"意識的に多様なバックグラウンドを持つ作家を読むようにしている人はどれくらいいるでしょうか。","the_new_excerpt":"私が尋ねたのは、今年初めて52冊の本のチャレンジに挑戦したからです。\n読んだ本を記録することで、作品の背景にまで気を配るようになったのです。\n読書の記録を取ることで、自分が関わっている様々な作家の背景にも注目するようになりました。\n\n先日、59冊に到達したので（達成感あり！）、次は...と決めていました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你们中有多少人有意识地努力阅读来自不同背景的作者？","the_new_excerpt":"我这样问是因为今年是我第一次尝试52本书的挑战。\n我发现，由于我在跟踪我的阅读，我更密切地注意到\n我发现，由于我在追踪我的阅读，我更加关注我所接触的各种作者的背景。\n\n我最近达到了59本书（超额完成！），决定去...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們中有多少人有意識地努力閱讀來自不同背景的作者？","the_new_excerpt":"我這樣問是因爲今年是我第一次嘗試52本書的挑戰。\n我發現，由於我在跟蹤我的閱讀，我更密切地注意到\n我發現，由於我在追蹤我的閱讀，我更加關注我所接觸的各種作者的背景。\n\n我最近達到了59本書（超額完成！），決定去...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-oyh1vo","previousId":"RedditPost-oyfdcv","nextId":"RedditPost-oyi0od","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/oyh1vo/the_mistborn_trilogy_by_brandon_sanderson/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
