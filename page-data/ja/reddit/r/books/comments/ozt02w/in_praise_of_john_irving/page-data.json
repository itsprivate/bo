I confess I haven’t really read any of his later work and apparently it falls of a cliff, but the three or so books of his ive read - and what I’ve read of Cider House today - honestly makes him one of my favourite storytellers alive, literary merits or otherwise notwithstanding. I’d compare his ability to craft a ‘ripping good yarn’, as they say, to Jonathan Franzen.
