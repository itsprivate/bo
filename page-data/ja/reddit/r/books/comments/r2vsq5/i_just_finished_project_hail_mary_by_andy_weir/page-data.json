I found a <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/\">reddit link</a> leading to &quot;Penguin Random House&quot; &#39;s list of 2021&#39;s best books. I had just finished a few books and was looking for something good to pass my time. didn&#39;t think I would come in contact with possibly one of my favorite books this year (I finished it in two days).<br/>\nOf course, from the first chapter I recognized the same style as &quot;The Martian&quot; and kept wondering if it&#39;s the same author:<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">it is</span>.<br/>\nI don&#39;t wanna spoil anything. Practically talking about any aspect of it spoils the experience, but to give you the general idea: &quot;A man is in space&quot;. That&#39;s all you need and it&#39;s all in the cover.  </p>\n\n<p>The writing is incredible, also very easy to understand. the physics and math is well explained for people who forgot that kind of stuff, and practically a walk in the park for people who retained their highschool-level science education.<br/>\nCharacter building is sublime and you&#39;ll feel tethered to the main Character.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes; My voice sparked amidst a paragraph and scared me because I was so invested in the story. My mind used most of it&#39;s power to build the world around it.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t talk much about it. But if you&#39;re looking for a good experience. I dearly recommend this book as it ignited my passion for science and more importantly, for &quot;hard science-fiction&quot;. One thing I learned, The best science fiction books are the ones set in your own time-line. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t wait what else will come from my newest favorite author.  </p>\n\n<p>To the Author: Thank you, you&#39;ve made me a very happy person</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/r2vsq5/i_just_finished_project_hail_mary_by_andy_weir/","title":"I just finished \"Project Hail Mary\" By Andy Weir (Must Read) -no spoilers-","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"November 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-26T22:20:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-26 22:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r2vsq5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r2vsq5/i_just_finished_project_hail_mary_by_andy_weir/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r2vsq5/i_just_finished_project_hail_mary_by_andy_weir/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Punk_Saint","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Punk_Saint","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Punk_Saint","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アンディ・ウィアー著「Project Hail Mary」（必読）を読み終えました。","the_new_excerpt":"本を読んでこんなに恍惚とした気分になったのは、「秘伝」以来です。\n\n3日前。redditのリンクを見つけました\n[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/]\nペンギン・ランダム・ハウス」の2021年のベスト・ブック・リストへのリンクを見つけました。私はちょうど\n数冊の本を読み終えて、探していたところ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我刚刚读完安迪-威尔的《万福玛利亚计划》（必读）--没有剧透--。","the_new_excerpt":"自《秘史》以来，我还没有在读完一本书后感到如此狂喜。\n\n三天前。我发现了一个reddit链接\n[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/]\n通向 \"企鹅兰登书屋 \"的2021年最佳图书名单。我当时刚\n我刚刚读完几本书，正在寻找...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我剛剛讀完安迪-威爾的《萬福瑪利亞計劃》（必讀）--沒有劇透--。","the_new_excerpt":"自《祕史》以來，我還沒有在讀完一本書後感到如此狂喜。\n\n三天前。我發現了一個reddit鏈接\n[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/]\n通向 \"企鵝蘭登書屋 \"的2021年最佳圖書名單。我當時剛\n我剛剛讀完幾本書，正在尋找...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r2rsh2","excerpt":"I was having a discussion with some friends about how a lot of the books we read\nas teens or our early twenties just did not age well.
