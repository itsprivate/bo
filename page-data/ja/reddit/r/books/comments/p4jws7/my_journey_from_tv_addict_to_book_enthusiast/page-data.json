Books didn’t feature much in my childhood except for goosebumps and Harry Potter. </p>\n\n<p>When I moved into a place of my own with my wife we to would have the tv on when we were at home unless we were doing some chores or going out, usually if we had people over the tv would be on still. We became friends with a retired couple over the road and when we went over they had the tv off which I found a bit uncomfortable to begin with as there was no safety net to fall to in the event of a dip in conversation, having said that me and my wife thought it was great and decided going forward we would not have the distraction of tv on when we had guests over.</p>\n\n<p>Tv still was a massive part of my life though, I’d have to watch tv or a film before bed to wind down and if I went to the gym before work I’d need to watch tv too so I felt I’d had time to relax to which actually had the opposite effect as there was never enough time. Books only featured for me when I went on a beach holiday except for the occasional Dan brown book. I’d always find programmes to watch on tv and just chill out to. </p>\n\n<p>Then last year about two months into the pandemic I hit a real low point. I wasn’t being a great husband or dad and eventually I went to the see my doctor with what I thought was depression. My doctor said I had low mood and recommended I change some bad habits such as going on phone first thing as I woke up. This is when he suggested reading to me. </p>\n\n<p>I read 5 books during the year and started talking to my wife more and slowly started reducing the amount of tv packages we had and watched. </p>\n\n<p>This year I set myself a target of 12 books and I am so far on number 14 having read an eclectic mix of books. I now hardly ever watch TV unless I am informed of something that sounds of significant interest to me or me and my wife just fancy the odd treat of chilling out in front of the tv. (She too has become an avid reader) </p>\n\n<p>I am so happy that I found reading and I feel it has brought so many positives to my life including an increased vocabulary, trips to the library with my 3 year old daughter and something for me and my sister to connect over. I find myself more interested in games of scrabble and have started occasionally using a thesaurus when I need to find a better word. </p>\n\n<p>I still struggle with life a fair bit but reading is something that is helping me greatly and I am happy to have found an online community.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p4jws7/my_journey_from_tv_addict_to_book_enthusiast/","title":"My journey from TV addict to book enthusiast.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-15T03:44:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-15 03:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p4jws7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p4jws7/my_journey_from_tv_addict_to_book_enthusiast/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p4jws7/my_journey_from_tv_addict_to_book_enthusiast/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Morgan-dollar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Morgan-dollar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Morgan-dollar","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テレビ中毒から本好きへの道のり。","the_new_excerpt":"私は、常にテレビがついている家庭で育ち、毎晩一晩中テレビがついているのが当たり前でした。\n毎晩一晩中テレビがついているのが当たり前でした。私の子供時代には、鳥肌が立つようなハリー・ポッター以外、本はあまり登場しませんでした。\n鳥肌が立つようなハリー・ポッターを除いては。\n\n妻と一緒に自分の家に引っ越したときも、家にいるときはテレビがついていました。\n家にいるときはテレビをつけていましたが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我从电视成瘾者到图书爱好者的旅程。","the_new_excerpt":"我在一个总是开着电视的家庭中长大，电视自然而然地每天晚上都开着。\n每晚都是整晚开着。书籍在我的童年中并没有什么特点，除了\n除了鸡皮疙瘩和哈利波特。\n\n当我和我的妻子搬到一个属于自己的地方时，我们也会开着电视。\n我们在家里的时候，除非...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從電視成癮者到圖書愛好者的旅程。","the_new_excerpt":"我在一個總是開着電視的家庭中長大，電視自然而然地每天晚上都開着。\n每晚都是整晚開着。書籍在我的童年中並沒有什麼特點，除了\n除了雞皮疙瘩和哈利波特。\n\n當我和我的妻子搬到一個屬於自己的地方時，我們也會開着電視。\n我們在家裏的時候，除非...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p48mj6","excerpt":"I always find myself reading rather heavy material (I love to learn and am a\nhuge nonfiction fan) but I really need some lightness in my life.","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/p48mj6/what_are_your_favorite_lighthearted_reads_that/","title":"What are your favorite lighthearted reads that are still well-written?","date":"August 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"軽い読み物で、なおかつしっかりとした内容のものはありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私はいつも、どちらかというと重い内容の本を読んでいます（学ぶことが好きで、ノンフィクションの大ファンです）。\n勉強が好きで、ノンフィクションの大ファンなのですが、人生には明るさが必要です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你最喜欢哪些仍然写得很好的轻松读物？","the_new_excerpt":"我总是发现自己在阅读相当沉重的材料（我喜欢学习，并且是一个巨大的非小说迷）。\n但我真的需要一些轻松的东西在我的生活中。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你最喜歡哪些仍然寫得很好的輕鬆讀物？","the_new_excerpt":"我總是發現自己在閱讀相當沉重的材料（我喜歡學習，並且是一個巨大的非小說迷）。\n但我真的需要一些輕鬆的東西在我的生活中。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-p4mku0","excerpt":"Seriously, kids fantasy books about fighting aliens with your cool animal\npowers, and it's 63 books of emotional termoil, ptsd, depression, torture, the\nhorrors of war and everyone is a bastard.\n\nThere's even one book were Rachel (who is 13 at the time) straight up nearly\ngets raped, and Marco is…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p4mku0/i_just_finished_rereading_the_animorphs_and/","title":"I just finished rereading the Animorphs, and goddamned those books are dark!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 15, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私はちょうどAnimorphsを読み直したところですが、あの本は暗いですね。","the_new_excerpt":"真面目な話、子供向けのファンタジー本では、クールな動物の力を使って宇宙人と戦う。\n感情的な苦悩、PTSD、うつ病、拷問、戦争の悲惨さを描いた63冊の本があります。\n感情的な苦悩、PTSD、うつ病、拷問、戦争の恐怖、そして誰もがろくでなしという内容の63冊です。\n\nレイチェル（当時13歳）がレイプされそうになった本もあります。\nレイプされそうになったり、マルコが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我刚刚读完《阿尼莫夫》，该死的那些书都是黑暗的。","the_new_excerpt":"说真的，孩子们的幻想书是关于用你很酷的动物力量来对抗外星人的。\n这是63本关于情绪波动、创伤后遗症、抑郁症、酷刑、战争恐怖的书。\n战争的恐怖和每个人都是一个混蛋。\n\n甚至有一本书中，瑞秋（当时13岁）差点被强奸。\n被强奸了，而马可是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我剛剛讀完《阿尼莫夫》，該死的那些書都是黑暗的。","the_new_excerpt":"說真的，孩子們的幻想書是關於用你很酷的動物力量來對抗外星人的。\n這是63本關於情緒波動、創傷後遺症、抑鬱症、酷刑、戰爭恐怖的書。\n戰爭的恐怖和每個人都是一個混蛋。\n\n甚至有一本書中，瑞秋（當時13歲）差點被強姦。\n被強姦了，而馬可是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-p4jws7","previousId":"RedditPost-p48mj6","nextId":"RedditPost-p4mku0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/p4jws7/my_journey_from_tv_addict_to_book_enthusiast/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
