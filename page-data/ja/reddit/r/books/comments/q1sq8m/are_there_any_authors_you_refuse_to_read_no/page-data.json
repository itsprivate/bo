The reviews I first came across were quite promising and I had high hopes. A friend of mine and I read it together as our sort of private bookclub read. There were so many times where I just wanted to rip it to pieces because I hated it so much, but I pushed through, hoping to find some kind of connection or respect for this book and in some way the author. But that never happened. </p>\n\n<p>So now I refuse to read anything she writes. Even though I saw a more recent book from her suggested in a post about book recs for people who loved The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a common thing?
