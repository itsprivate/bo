I know a lot of people talk about really falling in love with characters in books and to some extent while I always liked certain characters, I never had that &quot;love&quot; for them that I see other people describe. </p>\n\n<p>But reading about Evelyn Hugo.....wow....I haven&#39;t met a character as real as her in a book, just like the main character in the story, I was completely enraptured by Evelyn even with all her flaws and eccentricities. I know she wasn&#39;t a saint but that did not stop me from wanting to know more about her. Major props to Taylor Jenkins Reid for creating such a complex character you cannot help but root for. The whole time I was reading I was completely sucked into her world and I enjoyed every second of it.  I really cannot put my thoughts into words after finishing the novel but I am happy that I got to read about her story through this book. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot wait to read more books and discover amazingly written characters such as Evelyn!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q7w9n1/i_just_finished_reading_the_seven_husbands_of/","title":"I just finished reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo...","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-14T21:40:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-14 21:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q7w9n1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q7w9n1/i_just_finished_reading_the_seven_husbands_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q7w9n1/i_just_finished_reading_the_seven_husbands_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"_harleys","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_harleys","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_harleys","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"エヴリン・ヒューゴの7人の夫』を読み終えて...。","the_new_excerpt":"この本は広く推薦されていたので、私のTBRの一番上にあったのですが、期待を裏切りませんでした。\n期待を裏切りませんでした。多くの人が、本の中のキャラクターに本当に恋をしたと話しているのを知っています。\n本の中のキャラクターに恋をするという話はよく聞きますが、私もある程度は特定のキャラクターが好きでした。\n他の人が見ているような「愛」を感じることはありませんでした。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我刚刚读完《伊夫林-雨果的七个丈夫》。","the_new_excerpt":"这本书被广泛推荐，所以它在我的TBR中名列前茅，而且它没有让我失望。\n让人失望 我知道很多人都在谈论真正爱上了书中的人物。\n在某种程度上，虽然我一直喜欢某些角色，但我从来没有像其他人那样 \"爱 \"他们。\n我从来没有像其他人那样 \"爱 \"过他们。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我剛剛讀完《伊夫林-雨果的七個丈夫》。","the_new_excerpt":"這本書被廣泛推薦，所以它在我的TBR中名列前茅，而且它沒有讓我失望。\n讓人失望 我知道很多人都在談論真正愛上了書中的人物。\n在某種程度上，雖然我一直喜歡某些角色，但我從來沒有像其他人那樣 \"愛 \"他們。\n我從來沒有像其他人那樣 \"愛 \"過他們。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q7wxun","excerpt":"I saw a similar discussion in r/fantasy [/r/fantasy] and I wanted to put my two\ncents in.\n\nFor me it was sweetmeats.
