But personally, I loved the book for how much there is going on. Here are just some of my general thoughts and insights: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I loved Catherine&#39;s character a LOT considering how I primed myself to dislike her given how people felt about her. She did not act like a &quot;lady&quot; and it broke my heart when she decided to just conform to society&#39;s expectations. </li>\n<li>Nelly is such an unreliable narrator so it makes you think about whether she is exaggerating things based on who she favors -- she sympathized a lot with young Heathcliff and despised Catherine when they were young but when she resided with the Lintons, her perspective shifts for those two. Makes you think if they really have changed after all those years or just her perspective did. </li>\n<li>Heathcliff and Catherine&#39;s intense passionate love was so dysfunctional it never could work, but it really what drove the entire story from start to end. The whole &quot;haunt me&quot; line of Healthcliff really stayed with me, makes you wonder how much of his actions after her death really was because he was swayed by her ghost? </li>\n<li>Yes Heathcliff tried to replicate that abuse in the second generation of kids, but the natural relationship that blossomed with Hareton and Cathy took me by surprise, it felt like what Healthcliff and Catherine idealized, in another life. Even if Linton was his biological son, Hareton acted more like a standin for Healthcliff while Linton was Hindley and Cathy was Catherine. So in a way Cathy and Hareton&#39;s happy ending was what Healthcliff and Catherine never got. </li>\n<li>It was a hard book to go through because the bleak atmosphere was really strong, but as someone who likes emo music and how melodramatic the lyrics are, how the characters acted are very right up my alley. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All in all, I&#39;m glad I went through and read this book. If I had read this when I was in school I probably would not have appreciated it as much as I did now. Not sure if any of the movie adaptations are worth checking out because apparently none of them really capture the story of the book. </p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on Wuthering Heights?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qanyiy/just_finished_wuthering_heights/","title":"Just finished Wuthering Heights...","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-19T02:28:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-19 02:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qanyiy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qanyiy/just_finished_wuthering_heights/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qanyiy/just_finished_wuthering_heights/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"_harleys","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_harleys","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_harleys","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ちょうど『Wuthering Heights』を読み終えたところです...。","the_new_excerpt":"この本が、好きか嫌いか、その中間がないというのはよくわかる。\nこの本が好きか嫌いかの中間がないのもよくわかります。しかし、個人的には、この本がいかに多くのことが起こっているかという点で気に入りました。ここでは\n私の一般的な考えや洞察のいくつかを紹介します。\n\n * 私はキャサリンのキャラクターを愛していたロットは、私が与えられた彼女を嫌うために自分自身をどのようにプライミングしたかを考えると...\n   与えられた彼女を嫌うために自分自身を準備したことを考えると、私はキャサリンのキャラクターをたくさん愛していました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"刚刚完成《呼啸山庄》...","the_new_excerpt":"我完全明白为什么这本书要么是爱它，要么是恨它，没有中间的。\n之间。但就我个人而言，我喜欢这本书，因为它有很多事情要做。这里\n以下是我的一些总体想法和见解。\n\n * 我非常喜欢凯瑟琳的性格，因为我认为她的性格是我最喜欢的。\n   我非常喜欢凯瑟琳的性格，因为我认为自己会不喜欢她。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛剛完成《呼嘯山莊》...","the_new_excerpt":"我完全明白爲什麼這本書要麼是愛它，要麼是恨它，沒有中間的。\n之間。但就我個人而言，我喜歡這本書，因爲它有很多事情要做。這裏\n以下是我的一些總體想法和見解。\n\n * 我非常喜歡凱瑟琳的性格，因爲我認爲她的性格是我最喜歡的。\n   我非常喜歡凱瑟琳的性格，因爲我認爲自己會不喜歡她。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qamfx2","excerpt":"I really loved the World War Z because it tells stories before and during the\noutbreak.
