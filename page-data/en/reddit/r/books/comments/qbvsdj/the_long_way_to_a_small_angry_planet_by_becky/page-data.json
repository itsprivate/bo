I finally gave a few of her books a shot and they&#39;re among the best I&#39;ve read all year.</p>\n\n<p>She deals in smaller-scale stuff--no grand space operas, no worlds at stake. It&#39;s about small groups of people in a big galaxy, dealing with cultures and societal structures way bigger than they are. The world doesn&#39;t budge for them the way it does in so many other SF/F books. The overarching themes revolve around social justice, and play out through character study. You get to know people and their problems, and how they relate to each other. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t stand being preached at (blame a childhood spent in churches), so the way Chambers goes about her themes is refreshing. She doesn&#39;t beat you over the head with moral-of-the-story dialogue and treats her readers with respect rather than talking down to them as soooooo many authors do when discussing equality. She acknowledges that the privileged have a right to an opinion on how to handle societal problems, rather than insisting that they merely listen and obey. </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s more, she follows the sci-fi tradition of handling big theoretical ideas in application-based terms. She makes you really think about what it means to live in a multicultural society, and how to handle when those cultures irreconcilably disagree. She poses questions that don&#39;t actually have good answers, and explores the limits of what a toleration-based society is capable of. She makes you wonder about your place in your own society--wherever that may be. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Read the book! It&#39;s short.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qbvsdj/the_long_way_to_a_small_angry_planet_by_becky/","title":"The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-20T13:31:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-20 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qbvsdj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qbvsdj/the_long_way_to_a_small_angry_planet_by_becky/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qbvsdj/the_long_way_to_a_small_angry_planet_by_becky/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Sawses","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sawses","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Sawses","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"小さな怒りの星への長い道のり by ベッキー・チェンバース","the_new_excerpt":"PrintSFでChambersが推薦されているのを見たので、この推薦文を投稿したいと思います。\nここ数年、PrintSFではChambersが推奨されています。ついに彼女の本をいくつか読んでみました。\n彼女の本は今年読んだ本の中でも最高のものでした。\n\n彼女は小規模なものを扱っていて、壮大なスペースオペラや世界観はありません...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"贝基-钱伯斯的《通往小而愤怒的星球的漫长道路》。","the_new_excerpt":"我想把这份推荐书扔出去，因为我看到钱伯斯在PrintSF上被推荐了好几年。\n因为我看到钱伯斯在PrintSF上被推荐，好像已经有几年了。我终于试读了几本\n她的书，它们是我今年读过的最好的书之一。\n\n她的作品规模较小--没有宏大的太空歌剧，也没有世界末日。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"貝基-錢伯斯的《通往小而憤怒的星球的漫長道路》。","the_new_excerpt":"我想把這份推薦書扔出去，因爲我看到錢伯斯在PrintSF上被推薦了好幾年。\n因爲我看到錢伯斯在PrintSF上被推薦，好像已經有幾年了。我終於試讀了幾本\n她的書，它們是我今年讀過的最好的書之一。\n\n她的作品規模較小--沒有宏大的太空歌劇，也沒有世界末日。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qbyzw9","excerpt":"Not only bad books, with a weird writing style, bad plot and horrible\ncharacterisation, but also books that you’ve started thinking they were going to\nbe great, and were instead quite underwhelming.\n\nI’ve had a few of those recently, and it always makes me so unreasonably upset.\nBooks that were…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qbyzw9/what_are_the_worst_books_youve_ever_read/","title":"What are the worst books you’ve ever read?","date":"October 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今まで読んだ中で一番ひどい本は何ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"奇妙な文体、悪いプロット、ひどいキャラクター設定の悪い本だけでなく\n悪い本だけではなく、素晴らしい本だと思って読み始めた本でも\nまた、素晴らしい本だと思って読み始めた本も、実際にはとてもがっかりさせられました。\n\n私も最近そういうのがいくつかあって、いつも無性に腹が立ちます。\nそのような本は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你读过的最糟糕的书是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"不仅是那些写作风格怪异、情节糟糕、人物描写可怕的坏书。\n也有一些书，你开始时以为它们会很好，但结果却令人失望。\n优秀的书，但却让人很不满意。\n\n我最近有几本这样的书，它总是让我不合理地感到不安。\n这些书是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你讀過的最糟糕的書是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"不僅是那些寫作風格怪異、情節糟糕、人物描寫可怕的壞書。\n也有一些書，你開始時以爲它們會很好，但結果卻令人失望。\n優秀的書，但卻讓人很不滿意。\n\n我最近有幾本這樣的書，它總是讓我不合理地感到不安。\n這些書是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qbzg28","excerpt":"Books that tackle such longing, such feeling of worthlessness.
