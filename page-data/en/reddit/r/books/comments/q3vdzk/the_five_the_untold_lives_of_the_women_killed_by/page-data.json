In the case of media focused on the Ripper specifically, there&#39;s a tendency to mythologise the killer and stereotype the victims. I might even have avoided this book if it weren&#39;t for my book club.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, I ended up enjoying it much more than the other, true crime fan, book club members. <em>The Five</em> is more women&#39;s social history than it is anything else. All these women were victims of victorian moral and social attitudes long before they were murdered. Annie Chapman, for example, lost several siblings within weeks of each other as a child, her father to suicide, and her 12-year-old daughter. Without any real form of bereavement counselling or other mental health treatment, it&#39;s little wonder she became dependent on alcohol, and once that happened she had even less support and suffered even more judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Rubenhold doesn&#39;t go into the gory details of the murders themselves, just the moments leading up to them and the aftermath. There is so much tragedy in these women&#39;s stories that their deaths feel inevitable, and in some cases almost a relief. By necessity, Rubenhold frequently resorts to speculation and there are a lot of statements beginning &#39;she must have&#39; and &#39;she would have&#39;. This isn&#39;t the author&#39;s fault; these women hardly ever got to speak for themselves and about half of them couldn&#39;t even write. They are daughters, wives, sisters, mothers, lovers and friends, but they never quite manage to feel like individuals.</p>\n\n<p>X-post <a href=\"/r/UKBooks\">/r/UKBooks</a> and <a href=\"/r/nonfictionbooks\">/r/nonfictionbooks</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q3vdzk/the_five_the_untold_lives_of_the_women_killed_by/","title":"The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper by Hallie Rubenhold","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-08T12:36:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-08 12:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q3vdzk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q3vdzk/the_five_the_untold_lives_of_the_women_killed_by/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q3vdzk/the_five_the_untold_lives_of_the_women_killed_by/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"satanspanties","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/satanspanties","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"satanspanties","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ザ・ファイブ 切り裂きジャックに殺された女性たちの知られざる人生 by Hallie Rubenhold","the_new_excerpt":"他の優れたノンフィクションと同様に、この本は私に多くのことを考えさせてくれました。\n\nというのも、多くのテレビ番組やポッドキャスト、書籍はセンセーショナルな内容が多く、被害者に焦点を当てたものが少ないからです。\n多くのテレビ番組やポッドキャスト、書籍がセンセーショナルに扱われ、被害者に焦点を当てたものが少ないからです。特にリッパーに焦点を当てたメディアの場合\n特にリッパーに焦点を当てたメディアの場合、犯人を神話化する傾向があります...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"The Five: 被开膛手杰克杀害的妇女的不为人知的生活》，作者Hallie Rubenhold","the_new_excerpt":"像所有最好的非虚构作品一样，这本书给了我很多思考。\n\n我通常会避开真实犯罪，因为许多电视节目、播客和书籍都非常耸人听闻，很少关注受害者。\n因为很多电视节目、播客和书籍都非常耸人听闻，而且很少关注受害者。在媒体关注开膛手的情况下\n特别是关于开膛手的媒体，有一种将凶手神化的趋势。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"The Five: 被開膛手傑克殺害的婦女的不爲人知的生活》，作者Hallie Rubenhold","the_new_excerpt":"像所有最好的非虛構作品一樣，這本書給了我很多思考。\n\n我通常會避開真實犯罪，因爲許多電視節目、播客和書籍都非常聳人聽聞，很少關注受害者。\n因爲很多電視節目、播客和書籍都非常聳人聽聞，而且很少關注受害者。在媒體關注開膛手的情況下\n特別是關於開膛手的媒體，有一種將兇手神化的趨勢。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q3nfuq","excerpt":"The trippier the better.
