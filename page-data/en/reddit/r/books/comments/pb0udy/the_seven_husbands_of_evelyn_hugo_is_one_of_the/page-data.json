Evelyn was a very layered character. Her ambition was ruthless in the beginning, yes, but she really grew as a person. As she got older she grew wiser and more nuanced. Which I think is attributed to the fact that this book was written by a woman. I’m not certain a male author would’ve had the discipline to give Evelyn that level of warmth and compassion without falling into the above trope that usually befalls anti-heroes(especially white male ones).</p>\n\n<p>She was a woman of several contradictions. In a small way, she reminds me of Joe Gideon from All That Jazz, someone so convinced they’re going to hell for the way they’ve treated people, that they fail to realize that when you peel back the layers, they’re a decent person.</p>\n\n<p>Convinced she had a heart of ice, time and time Evelyn proved the contrary, she had a heart of gold and the Hollywood machine never claimed her humanity. </p>\n\n<p>She really did love her significant other, and truly would give up everything for them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I suck at articulating my thoughts. Give the book a read. You’re definitely in for an adventure. Phenomenal highs and tearful lows. A nice little subversion of tropes, and a powerful, if even a little tragic, love story.</p>\n\n<p>Also Brittany Snow was born to play Celia St. James for the adaption.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pb0udy/the_seven_husbands_of_evelyn_hugo_is_one_of_the/","title":"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the best books I’ve ever read!","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"August 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-25T11:30:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-25 11:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pb0udy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pb0udy/the_seven_husbands_of_evelyn_hugo_is_one_of_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pb0udy/the_seven_husbands_of_evelyn_hugo_is_one_of_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Prof_Tickles","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Prof_Tickles","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Prof_Tickles","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"エブリン・ヒューゴの7人の夫』は、私がこれまでに読んだ本の中でも最高の一冊です。","the_new_excerpt":"よくある「冷酷な野心を持ったキャラクターが、自分のケーキを食べたいと思っている」というのを少しだけ覆しています。\n自分のケーキを食べたいと思っている」。エブリンはこんな感じだと思っていました。\n欲しいものを手に入れるために「もっと力を」と常に信じているマキャベリ的なキャラクターだと思っていました。\n欲しいものを手に入れるための解決策だと信じていて、多くの「反...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"伊夫林-雨果的七个丈夫》是我读过的最好的书之一!","the_new_excerpt":"对通常的 \"具有无情的野心的人物想得到他们的蛋糕并吃掉它 \"的一个很好的小颠覆。\n蛋糕和吃它。\" 我以为伊夫林会是这样的\n马基雅维利式的人物，正如我上面所说，她总是相信 \"更多的权力\"。\n是得到她想要的东西的解决办法，而且像很多 \"反 \"的人一样。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伊夫林-雨果的七個丈夫》是我讀過的最好的書之一!","the_new_excerpt":"對通常的 \"具有無情的野心的人物想得到他們的蛋糕並喫掉它 \"的一個很好的小顛覆。\n蛋糕和喫它。\" 我以爲伊夫林會是這樣的\n馬基雅維利式的人物，正如我上面所說，她總是相信 \"更多的權力\"。\n是得到她想要的東西的解決辦法，而且像很多 \"反 \"的人一樣。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pauqjs","excerpt":"Love hitchhikers guide to the galaxy too reminded me a lot of that","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/pauqjs/loved_terry_prachetts_guards_guards_where_to_go/","title":"Loved terry prachett’s “guards guards” where to go next in the dis world series?","date":"August 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テリー・プラチェットの「guards guards」が好きだった ディス・ワールドシリーズの次の展開は？","the_new_excerpt":"Love Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy too reminded me a lot of that","locale":"ja"},{"title":"喜欢特里-普雷切特的 \"卫兵卫兵\"，下一步在DIS世界系列中去哪里？","the_new_excerpt":"喜欢《银河系的搭车指南》，也让我想起了很多。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"喜歡特里-普雷切特的 \"衛兵衛兵\"，下一步在DIS世界系列中去哪裏？","the_new_excerpt":"喜歡《銀河系的搭車指南》，也讓我想起了很多。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pbb8s8","excerpt":"I was reading the Wikipedia page on Mary Doria Russell\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Doria_Russell] and nearly choked on my\ncoffee when I came across this line, about her book The Sparrow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrow_(novel)]:\n\n> Because of the quality of its writing, and the…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pbb8s8/on_science_fiction_being_serious_literature/","title":"On science fiction being \"serious literature\"","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 25, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サイエンス・フィクションが \"シリアスな文学 \"であることについて","the_new_excerpt":"メアリー・ドリア・ラッセルのウィキペディアのページを読んでいたら\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Doria_Russell]を読んでいて、彼女の著書「The Sparrow」についての\n彼女の著書『The Sparrow』[(novel)]についてのこの一行を目にしたとき、私はコーヒーを詰まらせそうになった。\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrow_(小説)]:\n\n> その文章の質の高さ、そして、このような作品を作ることができたのは...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"关于科幻小说是 \"严肃文学\"","the_new_excerpt":"我在阅读维基百科中关于玛丽-多利亚-罗素的页面时\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Doria_Russell]，当我看到这句话时，差点被我的咖啡呛到。\n当我看到这句话时，差点被我的咖啡呛到，关于她的书《麻雀》。\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrow_（小说）]。\n\n> 由于其写作质量，以及...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於科幻小說是 \"嚴肅文學\"","the_new_excerpt":"我在閱讀維基百科中關於瑪麗-多利亞-羅素的頁面時\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Doria_Russell]，當我看到這句話時，差點被我的咖啡嗆到。\n當我看到這句話時，差點被我的咖啡嗆到，關於她的書《麻雀》。\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrow_（小說）]。\n\n> 由於其寫作質量，以及...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pb0udy","previousId":"RedditPost-pauqjs","nextId":"RedditPost-pbb8s8","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/pb0udy/the_seven_husbands_of_evelyn_hugo_is_one_of_the/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
