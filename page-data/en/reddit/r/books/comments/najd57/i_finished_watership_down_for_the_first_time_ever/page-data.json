Recently, I&#39;ve just finished my second year of college and this book I had as a child called Confetti Girl by Diana Lopez was sitting there on my bookshelf. I picked it up since I never really read it and it kept mentioning Watership Down so I decided to read that next. Watership Down was a great book and I&#39;m glad I got to read it on my own terms and I don&#39;t have to analyze it in a certain way. To me, that makes it so much more enjoyable. I don&#39;t know what it is about Richard Adams&#39; writing, but I love how there&#39;s so much description among the action. </p>\n\n<p>I was definitely expecting a lot more death and violence since I saw a few clips of the movie years ago. The book felt cozy and when I was talking about it with my brother, I told him how it kind of reminded me of Lord of the Rings. My brother said that that&#39;s why he would describe it as an &#39;epic.&#39; I have more to say, but it would just be more rambling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/najd57/i_finished_watership_down_for_the_first_time_ever/","title":"I Finished Watership Down for the first time ever.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"May 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-12T11:43:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-12 11:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"najd57","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/najd57/i_finished_watership_down_for_the_first_time_ever/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/najd57/i_finished_watership_down_for_the_first_time_ever/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"LiltingSunrise","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LiltingSunrise","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LiltingSunrise","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ウォーターシップ・ダウン」を初めて完走しました。","the_new_excerpt":"15～16歳の頃、バーンズ・アンド・ノーブルズでリチャード・アダムスの『ウォーターシップ・ダウン』を手に入れました。\n読んでみたいと思いましたが、重い本だと思いました。最近ですね。\n大学2年生になったばかりですが、子供の頃に持っていた「Confetti Gir」という本は\nダイアナ・ロペスの「Confetti Girl」という本が、私の部屋に置いてありました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我有史以来第一次完成了《水浒传》。","the_new_excerpt":"当我大约15-16岁时，我在巴诺书店买到了理查德-亚当斯的《水浒传》。\n我想读它，但我知道它是一本很重的书。最近。\n我刚刚读完大学二年级，我小时候的这本书\n叫做《纸屑女孩》，作者是戴安娜-洛佩兹，就放在我的书架上。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我有史以來第一次完成了《水滸傳》。","the_new_excerpt":"當我大約15-16歲時，我在巴諾書店買到了理查德-亞當斯的《水滸傳》。\n我想讀它，但我知道它是一本很重的書。最近。\n我剛剛讀完大學二年級，我小時候的這本書\n叫做《紙屑女孩》，作者是戴安娜-洛佩茲，就放在我的書架上。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n9oh86","excerpt":"I have been reading a ton of books since the pandemic started, and my budget\ncouldn't keep up.
