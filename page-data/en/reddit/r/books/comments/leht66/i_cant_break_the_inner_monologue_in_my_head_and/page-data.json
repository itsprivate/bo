But, when it comes to reading in my head, I read every single word in either the characters voice, or my voice. If I try to speed up it literally sounds like they or I am speaking quite frantically. If I skim over the words without reading them out loud, I will literally forget the sentence that I just read. I just spent 7 hours, quite ironically, reading Astrophysics for people in a hurry, without rereading a single sentence. Apparently the average time this book should take to read is about 2 hours. That does not compute to me, and I was an honors english student in college, I dont feel slow lol.
