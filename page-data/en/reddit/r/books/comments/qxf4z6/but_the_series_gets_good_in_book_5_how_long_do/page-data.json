I hated it. Every word. As I finished each chapter, I wanted to tear the pages out and use it to wipe my butt. HATED it. I’m not going to name the series, because it’s not the point of this question; and, also, I’ve already heard all the rebuttals and I still want to put the book in the litter box so my cat pisses on it. </p>\n\n<p>The series has it’s fans, and I understand and respect that. It’s fine, really.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, anytime there’s a discussion around this particular book, I get the exact same rebuttal: “Of course the main character is insufferable in book one! It’s the set up for a character arc. It really starts getting good in book 3, 5, 19, 5,232,522.” “You can’t judge the book until you at least get to book 5. That’s when it all starts paying off.” “There’s a reason book one is like that. You have to get further in the series.”</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I probably won’t read it, because there’s plenty of book series out there where I don’t have to trudge through 2000 pages of something I hate before it “gets good”, but I’m wondering if other readers are more forgiving, and if they feel their investment was worth it. </p>\n\n<p>How often do you push through until a later book in the series on the promise of reputable people that it gets better? Do you trust those people, or are you the type to put the book out to pasture if book 1 doesn’t capture you? And, if you are the type to push through, how many books do you give a series before you give up?</p>\n\n<p>If you have any experiences to share where a later book completely recontextualizes the first books in a satisfying way, do tell! I honestly do like those kinds of book series.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’m glad for all the responses! On other forums, I’ve definitely encountered much of the opposite opinion, so it’s good to see this one, too.. I wonder, though, if I had named the book series, would there be more people saying, “You HAVE to continue!” I understand. I really do. I also love books that have evoked negative emotions in other people, so I sympathize.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qxf4z6/but_the_series_gets_good_in_book_5_how_long_do/","title":"“But the Series gets good in book 5!“: How long do you stick with a series?","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T22:38:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 22:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qxf4z6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qxf4z6/but_the_series_gets_good_in_book_5_how_long_do/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qxf4z6/but_the_series_gets_good_in_book_5_how_long_do/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"HelloDesdemona","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HelloDesdemona","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"HelloDesdemona","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"But the Series gets good in book 5!\": あなたはどのくらいシリーズを続けますか？","the_new_excerpt":"というわけで、前から気になっていたこのシリーズの1冊目を読んでみました。\n大嫌いな作品でした。すべての言葉が。各章を読み終えたとき、ページを破り捨てたくなりました。\nお尻を拭くのに使いたくなりました。大嫌いだ。そのシリーズの名前を言うつもりはありません。\nなぜなら、それはこの質問の趣旨ではないし、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"但是这个系列在第五本书里变得很好！\"。你会在一个系列中坚持多长时间？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我已经读了这个系列的第一本书，这个系列已经在我的视野里有一段时间了。\n我很讨厌它。每一个字。当我读完每一章时，我想把书页撕下来\n并用它来擦屁股。讨厌它。我不打算说出这个系列的名字。\n因为这不是这个问题的重点；而且，我已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"但是這個系列在第五本書裏變得很好！\"。你會在一個系列中堅持多長時間？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我已經讀了這個系列的第一本書，這個系列已經在我的視野裏有一段時間了。\n我很討厭它。每一個字。當我讀完每一章時，我想把書頁撕下來\n並用它來擦屁股。討厭它。我不打算說出這個系列的名字。\n因爲這不是這個問題的重點；而且，我已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qxkl9l","excerpt":"I've been waiting for this since I was 15.\n\n\"The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become\nlegend.\"\n\nIt took 20+ years to get through the books and I'm so excited to get home\ntonight and watch this series that has been with me longer than almost all of my\nrelationships.…","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qxkl9l/wheel_of_time_today_is_the_day_no_spoilers/","title":"Wheel of Time - Today is the day - No spoilers","date":"November 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"時の輪 - 今日という日 - ネタバレなし","the_new_excerpt":"15歳の時からずっと待っていました。\n\n\"時の輪が回り、時代が生まれては消え、伝説となる記憶を残す\n伝説となる。\"\n\n本を読み切るのに20年以上かかりましたが、今夜家に帰って、私の人生の中で最も長く付き合ってきたこのシリーズを見るのがとても楽しみです。\n今夜は家に帰って、私の人生の中で最も長く付き合ってきたこのシリーズを見るのがとても楽しみです。\n人間関係....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"时空之轮--今天是个好日子--没有剧透","the_new_excerpt":"我从15岁起就一直在等待这个机会。\n\n\"时间之轮转动，时代来了又去，留下的记忆成为\n传说\"。\n\n我花了20多年的时间才看完这些书，我很高兴今晚能回家看这个陪伴我很久的系列。\n我很高兴今晚能回家看这个系列，它陪伴我的时间几乎比我所有的时间都长。\n关系....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"時空之輪--今天是個好日子--沒有劇透","the_new_excerpt":"我從15歲起就一直在等待這個機會。\n\n\"時間之輪轉動，時代來了又去，留下的記憶成爲\n傳說\"。\n\n我花了20多年的時間纔看完這些書，我很高興今晚能回家看這個陪伴我很久的系列。\n我很高興今晚能回家看這個系列，它陪伴我的時間幾乎比我所有的時間都長。\n關係....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qxmb2c","excerpt":"…and really loved it.
