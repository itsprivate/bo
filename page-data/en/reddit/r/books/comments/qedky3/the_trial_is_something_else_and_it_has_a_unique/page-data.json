I trudged through the novel is because I found it difficult to keep engaged on the story for its long winded, indirect story-telling, which I made a <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p9bsfb/is_it_just_me_or_the_trial_does_not_go_straight/\">post</a> about before on this sub. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t bored with the story at all but rather I felt impatient because of its long-winded style of story telling and lack of directness for the most part. As I kept reading on though, I figured why Kafka wrote the story the way he did. Rather than write in a descriptive and flowery style, he wrote the story in a more methodical and deductive style to simulate the drudgery of bureaucratic process. It is though as if K.&#39;s journey is being told by a doctor making a diagnosis rather than a bard entertaining an audience. I haven&#39;t seen that style of writing before and I admit that I am impressed with Kafka for having thought to deliver the story in such a way as to make the audience feel being sucked into the complex technicalities and vertigo nature of bureaucracy. With that being said, yeah, I think Kafka knows exactly what he was doing when he wrote &quot;The Trial&quot;. He took our hands and gave us a tour on how bureaucracy works and its debilitating effect on the lives of ordinary beings, because Kafka worked in office environment before dealing with all sorts of nonsense in the system. I myself work in a bureaucratic industry but the part I would disagree with Kafka&#39;s general critique of the system is the chaos and doing things just for the sake of doing it. It has been over a hundred years since Kafka&#39;s time and in my experience, it&#39;s fair to say that bureaucracy has drastically improved with new science (or art depending how one sees it) of process improvement and streamlining, with concepts such as 5S, kanban, just-in-time, lean manufacturing etc, and this is aided by information technology and computers. Steps in a process that does not add value are cut. Of course, things still fall through the cracks and process streamlining is not uniform everywhere because of practical limitations.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is said that &quot;The Trial&quot; is really a story of tyranny of bureaucracy, which I completely agree with. I thought about before on how people would use the complexity of bureaucracy to shield themselves from being held accountable, particularly corrupt public officials who would exploit legal loopholes and do under-the-table bribery to prevent themselves from facing justice. Franz Kafka had eloquently put more life to this real life practice as an elaborate and rich metaphor. Even though the author hasn&#39;t finished the story and probably left it unpolished as a result, he was genius for his writing of &quot;The Trial&quot;. I will do another reading of the book at some point to catch more of what I missed.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d appreciate what any of you guys think of &quot;The Trial&quot; so please leave a comment!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qedky3/the_trial_is_something_else_and_it_has_a_unique/","title":"\"The Trial\" is something else and it has a unique story that left me pondering what it means.","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-24T05:21:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-24 05:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qedky3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qedky3/the_trial_is_something_else_and_it_has_a_unique/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qedky3/the_trial_is_something_else_and_it_has_a_unique/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"antiquated_bookworm","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/antiquated_bookworm","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"antiquated_bookworm","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"The Trial \"は別物で、ユニークなストーリーがあり、その意味を考えさせられました。","the_new_excerpt":"つい最近、フランツ・カフカの「裁判」を2ヶ月かけて読み終えました。\n信じられないかもしれませんが、読み終えました。私がこの小説を読むのに苦労したのは\n私がこの小説を読むのに苦労したのは、長々とした間接的な語り口のせいで、物語に夢中になるのが難しかったからです。\n語り口が長くて、話についていけなかったからです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"审判 \"是另一种东西，它有一个独特的故事，让我思考它的含义。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近刚读完弗朗茨-卡夫卡的《审判》，经过两个月的时间\n读完它，不管你信不信。我之所以艰难地读完这部小说，是因为我\n因为我发现它很难保持对故事的参与，因为它的故事很冗长，很间接。\n故事的叙述，我做了一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"審判 \"是另一種東西，它有一個獨特的故事，讓我思考它的含義。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近剛讀完弗朗茨-卡夫卡的《審判》，經過兩個月的時間\n讀完它，不管你信不信。我之所以艱難地讀完這部小說，是因爲我\n因爲我發現它很難保持對故事的參與，因爲它的故事很冗長，很間接。\n故事的敘述，我做了一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qed9dx","excerpt":"I want to read novels with a character like Hannibal Lecter but, make it female.\nBasically, if you know any female characters that are literally the female\nversion of Hannibal(yes, the cannibalism and everything), please suggest the\nbook!\n\nThank you in advance!!","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/qed9dx/novels_with_female_equivalent_of_hannibal_lecter/","title":"Novels with female equivalent of Hannibal Lecter??","date":"October 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ハンニバル・レクターに相当する女性が登場する小説？","the_new_excerpt":"ハンニバル・レクターのようなキャラクターの小説を読みたいのですが、女性にしたいのです。\n基本的には、文字通りハンニバルの女性版のような女性のキャラクターを知っていたら、その作品を紹介してください。\nハンニバルの文字通りの女性版（そう、カニバリズムとか）の女性キャラクターを知っていたら、その本を提案してください。\n本を紹介してください。\n\n宜しくお願いします!!!","locale":"ja"},{"title":"有相当于汉尼拔-莱克特的女性的小说吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我想读的小说有一个像汉尼拔-莱克特那样的角色，但是，要让它成为女性。\n基本上，如果你知道有什么女性角色是字面上的女性版汉尼拔（是的，吃人什么的），请推荐给我。\n的女版汉尼拔（是的，就是吃人和一切），请推荐这本书。\n书!\n\n提前感谢您！！！。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有相當於漢尼拔-萊克特的女性的小說嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我想讀的小說有一個像漢尼拔-萊克特那樣的角色，但是，要讓它成爲女性。\n基本上，如果你知道有什麼女性角色是字面上的女性版漢尼拔（是的，喫人什麼的），請推薦給我。\n的女版漢尼拔（是的，就是喫人和一切），請推薦這本書。\n書!\n\n提前感謝您！！！。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qecmbi","excerpt":"what are book that changed your life that aren’t like self help books","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/qecmbi/books_that_changed_your_life/","title":"books that changed your life","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"あなたの人生を変えた本","the_new_excerpt":"自己啓発本とは違う、人生を変えた本とは？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"改变你生活的书","the_new_excerpt":"什么是改变你生活的书，而不是像自我帮助的书？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"改變你生活的書","the_new_excerpt":"什麼是改變你生活的書，而不是像自我幫助的書？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qedky3","previousId":"RedditPost-qed9dx","nextId":"RedditPost-qecmbi","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/books/comments/qedky3/the_trial_is_something_else_and_it_has_a_unique/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
