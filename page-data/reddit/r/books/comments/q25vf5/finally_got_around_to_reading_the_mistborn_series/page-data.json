I guess I thought his work was &quot;over-hyped&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So I finally got around to reading the the first 3 books and was just blown away but them.</p>\n\n<p>The world building, the storylines, the character development, the way the drama unfolded was really epic.</p>\n\n<p>I literally could not put the books down, read them all within 2 weeks.  </p>\n\n<p>The concept of mistborns &amp; mistings is amazing!</p>\n\n<p>Vin was an amazing lead the way she developed as a character from being this broken, scared girl who trusted no one, that was abandoned by everyone,  to having an idenity crisis. Is she a skaa thief whos worth nothing? Is she a noble women or a skaa pretending to be one? The overwhelming responsibilities of protecting Elend and being the hero of ages, to finally accepting that she was a theif, a noble women, an empress, a powerful mistborn.</p>\n\n<p>Elend&#39;s own trials of a young man with ideals, on how the country should be run.  He was forced to grow from a young man with naive ideals, to a king who had tried to implement those said ideas and failed. To becoming an emperor who understood you have to compromise your morals to some extent to achieve the end goals. But through it all what I admired the most about Elend was and how he questioned himself, was this the right thing to do? He always cared for his people. Near the end he started to understand Rashek, and why he ruled the way he did.</p>\n\n<p>Kelsier was by far my favourite character, he was filled with revenge for the death of this wife and to bring justice to the skaa, to liberate them. The whole plot regarding his wife - mare betraying him, to finally coming to terms and finding closure that she did not do it on purpose. He was an impressive leader, he did act on impulse but always got the job done. I like how evenutally he became a sort of father figure to Vin, and even after his death the crew stuck around to see his dreams fulfilled. </p>\n\n<p>Marsh story was tragic. He had a strained relationship with Kelsier, he loved a women who married kelsier, he gave up on the rebellion after trying for so long, only for kelsier to be successful. He became an inquisitor, lost his humanity after ruin took control of him and used him. For me Kelsier was everything Marsh wanted to be. </p>\n\n<p>What did you like about the book?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q25vf5/finally_got_around_to_reading_the_mistborn_series/","title":"Finally got around to reading the mistborn series all i can say is WOW","tags":["books","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T02:16:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 02:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q25vf5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q25vf5/finally_got_around_to_reading_the_mistborn_series/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q25vf5/finally_got_around_to_reading_the_mistborn_series/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"books","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/books","author":"Zee180","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zee180","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Zee180","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"やっとミストボーンシリーズを読むことができましたが、一言で言うと「すごい」です。","the_new_excerpt":"私は長い間、ブランドン・サンダーソンの作品を読むことをなんとなく先延ばしにしてきました。\nみんなが彼のことを話していても 彼の作品は \"過大評価 \"されていると思っていたんですね。\n\nようやく最初の3冊を読むことができて、とても感激しました。\n驚きました。\n\n世界観、ストーリー展開、キャラクター...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"终于能读到《迷途》系列了，我只能说是惊叹。","the_new_excerpt":"长久以来，我一直有点不愿意读布兰登-桑德森的作品。\n尽管每个人都提到他! 我想我认为他的作品被 \"过度炒作 \"了。\n\n因此，我终于开始阅读前三本书，并被深深吸引。\n但他们。\n\n世界的构建、故事情节、人物形象......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"終於能讀到《迷途》系列了，我只能說是驚歎。","the_new_excerpt":"長久以來，我一直有點不願意讀布蘭登-桑德森的作品。\n儘管每個人都提到他! 我想我認爲他的作品被 \"過度炒作 \"了。\n\n因此，我終於開始閱讀前三本書，並被深深吸引。\n但他們。\n\n世界的構建、故事情節、人物形象......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q254vc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/books/comments/q254vc/levar_burton_named_grand_marshal_of_2022_rose/","title":"LeVar Burton Named Grand Marshal Of 2022 Rose Parade","date":"October 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"LeVar Burton、2022年ローズパレードのグランドマーシャルに就任","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"勒瓦尔-伯顿被任命为2022年玫瑰大游行的大元帅","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"勒瓦爾-伯頓被任命爲2022年玫瑰大遊行的大元帥","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q298wu","excerpt":"I’m reading All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy.
