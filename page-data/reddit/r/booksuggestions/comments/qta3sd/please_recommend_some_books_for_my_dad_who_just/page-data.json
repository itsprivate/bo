I’m a college student. It’s my dad’s birthday and he LOVES reading. He was a stay-at-home dad and he was just absolutely wonderful. When I was a kid, he would go out of his way to get me any book I asked for and he would always read to me before putting me to bed. To add on, he was always around when I needed him for something and he made it a personal mission to never miss a single one of my events. Anyway, he’s just an all-around amazing dad.</p>\n\n<p>My parents divorced after I left for college because their relationship just wasn’t working out. They parted on good terms and still keep in touch. Recently, my dad came out as gay. He was so worried about how I would react when he told me and he broke down when I said I still adored him just the same.</p>\n\n<p>It’s my dad’s birthday soon and I want him to know how thankful I’m for everything he did and continues to do for me. I’m throwing a party for him since his birthday falls during my break, and my high school friends recommended we each get him a book that centers around LGBTQIA+ themed plots. I&#39;m open to any genres that would be interesting to someone that’s middle-aged :D</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for helping make my dad&#39;s birthday extra special and I&#39;m so excited to read all your recommendations!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/booksuggestions/comments/qta3sd/please_recommend_some_books_for_my_dad_who_just/","title":"Please Recommend Some Books For My Dad Who Just Came Out As Gay","tags":["booksuggestions","reddit"],"date":"November 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-13T23:52:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-13 23:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qta3sd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/qta3sd/please_recommend_some_books_for_my_dad_who_just/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/qta3sd/please_recommend_some_books_for_my_dad_who_just/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"booksuggestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions","author":"Successful_Minute_87","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful_Minute_87","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Successful_Minute_87","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゲイであることを公表したばかりの父におすすめの本を教えてください。","the_new_excerpt":"やあ、本の仲間たちよ。\n\n今日は特定のリクエストのために来ました。私は大学生です。今日は父の\n誕生日で、彼は読書が大好きなんです。彼は専業主婦でしたが、とても素晴らしい人でした。\n本当に素晴らしいです。私が子供の頃、父は私が本を欲しがると、わざわざ買ってきてくれました。\nいつも本を読んでくれていました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"请为我刚出柜的父亲推荐一些书籍，他刚出柜就成了同性恋者","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，书友们。\n\n我今天来这里是为了一个特殊的请求。我是一名大学生。这是我父亲的\n生日，他喜欢读书。他是一个在家的父亲，他只是\n绝对精彩。当我还是个孩子时，他会不遗余力地给我买任何我想要的书。\n我想要的书，而且他总是给我读......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"請爲我剛出櫃的父親推薦一些書籍，他剛出櫃就成了同性戀者","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，書友們。\n\n我今天來這裏是爲了一個特殊的請求。我是一名大學生。這是我父親的\n生日，他喜歡讀書。他是一個在家的父親，他只是\n絕對精彩。當我還是個孩子時，他會不遺餘力地給我買任何我想要的書。\n我想要的書，而且他總是給我讀......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qt15h1","excerpt":"There are some books that feel fresh no matter how many times you read it in the\npast.
