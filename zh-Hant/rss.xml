And of course you must have learned this word from a book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start:
So back when I was 16, I learned this fancy new word while reading a book (i forget the book it was) : RENDEZVOUS. I thought it was really cool and looked up the meaning. It means a meeting or if you want to use it as a verb to meet at a certain time and place. A few days later, I was with a group of my friends and we were discussing coming together for  an event. So we needed to meetup. Enter perfect time to use the word RENDEZVOUS. Me being the prententious 16 year old brat I was said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s rendezvous at this particular place&amp;quot; and you can guess how I pronounced it. I said it how it is written but the actual pronounciation is: RON-DI-VOO. crazy! Annnnnd  I only found out how it was pronounced two years later while listening to a random non-fiction audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;

It &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a goldmine of information (millions of ratings and reviews, book recommendations, interactions with authors), but I often find it underwhelming in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things that stand out to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most books have a very similar rating.  It&amp;#39;s as if the law of large numbers ends up normalizing most books to be rated between 3.9 and 4.1 stars.  A few regular exceptions to the rule are: Long books almost always rated highly (presumably because one wouldn&amp;#39;t read a 1000 page book if they weren&amp;#39;t really enjoying it, or because one feels the need to justify spending that much time reading a single book) and YA books - often rated abnormally high (possibly due to the large presence of young adults usually social media in general)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews usually consist of generic 5 star reviews &amp;quot;OMG, this book was amazing!&amp;quot; and generic 1 star reviews &amp;quot;This book was boring, poorly written, and stupid!&amp;quot;  I rarely see anything of use in reviews that would help me decide whether or not it&amp;#39;s worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same 10 reviewers seem to consistently bubble up to the top.  (You know the ones I&amp;#39;m referring to:  The reviewers with glamor shots for profile pictures, who write as though they are B- students in AP English required to write a 1000 word essay, when all they have to say is &amp;quot;I liked the book&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Goodreads Choice Award winners are not the best books of the year, even by their own rating system.  They just end up being the books that people have heard of.  For example, &lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; is rated at 3.32 stars (which is abysmally low for Goodreads), but it ended up winning the 2015 Best Fiction award.  What???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being owned by Amazon, I&amp;#39;m inherently skeptical of any recommendations they give, as they may just be trying to promote a certain publisher or author who they have a special contract with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I have found the site is very useful for finding potential books to read, getting a quick look into an author&amp;#39;s works and getting updates, seeing what other books people liked who gave my favorite book 5 stars.  And honestly, the Genres listing is one of the most useful sections for me, so I can quickly get a sense of what type of book I&amp;#39;m dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you use Goodreads for?  What value does it provide to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His style of writing has elevated my language, speech, and vocabulary to such degrees that colleagues and friends often comment on how well I speak, and how refined and clear my writing is. I wholly attribute this to his works, since there is a notable elevation in my powers of expression while I am reading (or recently finished) one of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

Mostly Science Fiction and some random Stephen King. But sometime during high school I got out of the habit, and literally haven&amp;#39;t read an actual book since then.  Got into computers and programming in college, so I ended up filing my free time with computer stuff and books just fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to today (I&amp;#39;m 47) and I&amp;#39;m trying to detach myself from my cell phone somewhat.  Uninstalled Facebook, instagram, and a few others. We caught a couple episodes of Foundation on AppleTV, and I&amp;#39;m not sure what it was about that show, but I found it fascinating.   Got it into my head that it would be good for me to start reading books again. And I&amp;#39;ll be damned if I didn&amp;#39;t read the whole thing last night.  What a quick read! And I have to say it felt really good!  Just the process of sitting on the couch with a book, and getting caught up in some other world was such a nice change of pace from the normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what exactly the point of this post is, except that I&amp;#39;m kind of excited about reading again, and wanted to tell someone...😆 As far as the book goes, I was a little surprised that there wasn&amp;#39;t a little more happening at the end, but I suppose it IS just the beginning of a very long story.  Amazon has a &amp;quot;buy 2 get 1 free&amp;quot; sale on those books, so I just ordered the next 3 in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s no way to deny or justify the atrocity of the crime committed by Dick and Perry. But while I was reading it, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but develop a terrible sense of pity for Perry.

Video games, movies, music, reading. I was getting back into reading after getting my kindle around 2 years ago and was able to read some older sci-fi I enjoyed, and new stuff I hadn&amp;#39;t read. Around a year ago or more though depression started hitting me harder than normal and I found it hard to read as much, or enjoy what I was reading. I know I made a previous post a while back about new sci-fi vs old sci-fi and their differences as I wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of what I was reading much. I dropped a few books in a row. I started reading some older stuff as well, and was not getting much out of it either. I believe part of this may have been due to just a string of bad luck of picking things I ended up not enjoying (sad as one of these was by Asimov and I love his Foundation Trilogy).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got a new job and have been able to listen to audiobooks which really help to pass the time. I was really excited but having listened to about 5 books now I was surprised that I really wasn&amp;#39;t super into any of them. I felt bad as I thought I was just incapable of enjoying stories as much anymore, or my standards somehow randomly shot through the roof and now *everything* was just so cliche, or many plot points felt so childish and dumb for any reason. I was getting pretty upset by this. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to try newer sci-fi, and find some sort of large scale series that I could get into. Epic sci-fi always seemed so appealing to me but the few series I tried that were modern I just couldn&amp;#39;t get into. Finally I listened to the audiobook of Raft.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to say this is some milestone of literature, or some incredible feat of writing. I will simply say that I found a lot of joy in listening to this book. I enjoyed the strange world they were in, and the simple adventure story it followed. Something about it broke open my shell and allowed me to actually enjoy what I was listening to. I followed it up just this weekend by reading Timelike Infinity and I enjoyed it even more than Raft. I now definitely plan to read the rest of the series and feel like, even if I don&amp;#39;t find it the highest literature or the best writing I&amp;#39;ve read, it has had fun stories and an interesting universe that has been extremely pleasurable to read.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mainly wanted to write this to get this out because I&amp;#39;m just very happy at the moment that I finally found a (somewhat) modern sci-fi, large scale series that I&amp;#39;m actually finally interested in following through with reading and getting me out of my reading rut. Has anyone else had these types of moments where for some reason you just felt like you could not enjoy reading for some reason or another until some book helped you out of that rut, whether it was one of your favorites or not? What do you normally do when you do find yourself in one of these ruts?&lt;/p&gt;

Butler. I first picked it up because I was intrigued by the time travel aspect. As I read it, it definitely got me thinking about aspects of racism and slavery that I never considered before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wonder why this hasn&amp;#39;t been adapted into a film yet. I know adapting books to films is hard enough, and with this one especially, you&amp;#39;d really need the right team of people. But it was first published in the 70&amp;#39;s, and it&amp;#39;s still such a timely story. So why no adaptation? Does Octavia E. Butler&amp;#39;s estate not want that, that&amp;#39;s the only reason I can think of. I&amp;#39;m positive that in the right hands, this could make for an excellent film, or even a miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you all think? Do you want to see this book on the big/small screen?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;m looking more into it, and I see that as of March 2021, a pilot has been ordered by FX. So if all goes well, looks like this will be happening after all. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

He also does absolutely fantastic fantasy as well. He&amp;#39;s got a very dense style that can be difficult to get into, and his books are meant as rereads. Give them a try though, you won&amp;#39;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work on The Book of the new sun tetralogy (cycle?) Is beyond inspiring. He creates a world which is something more than it seems at first description. Every seems both a lie and the truth at the same time, does the main character really reverse death or was the recipient really dead, or merely wounded? Plus the world building is magical, Urth a planet with a sun so close to death the stars are visible in the daytime sky. It&amp;#39;s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;

The Harry Potter series is one for me because the story is so wonderful and I always pick up on new things and hidden references. Plus, it’s kind of nostalgic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Virgin Suicides is another one. I adore how the book was written. So different and I always feel a different type of emotion depending on where I’m at in my life. It’s never the same emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last is The Messenger. This book is so pure, wholehearted, and has so many life lessons. It’s a quick and addicting read but everyone should read it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honorable mention: The Giver&lt;/p&gt;

For me, difficulty may concern the subject matter, word usage, complexity of a story...or never-ending sentences, as this example from Woolf&amp;#39;s To the Lighthouse shows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was now formidable to behold, and it was only in silence, looking up from their plates, after she had spoken so severely about Charles Tansley, that her daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose--could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not always taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty, which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts, and made them...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is like 2/3 of the whole sentence, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t read books known for being extremely difficult to read, like Finnegans Wake, but of the ones I&amp;#39;ve read, Woolf has been the most difficult one.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually prefer this series to the Percy Jackson’s and want more people to know about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books still include the regular crew, Percy, Annabeth, Charon but it introduces 5 new heroes, some Greek, some Roman! The Greeks are Leo, Jason and Piper. The Romans are Frank, Hazel and kinda Jason too (the book explains better than I could sos) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 7 are on the quest that the prophecy that ended the last Percy Jackson book. The people trying to prevent this are Gaia, the earth herself and her children, the giants. Gaia is trying to wake and shake the world of her back and the giants are eliminating anyone trying to lull her back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each book is considerably long with the shortest one being 500 pages and there’s five books but over those 2600 pages, it tells one of the greatest stories I’ve read in awhile. It’s a little bit dumbed down for the younger target audience but still it’s a great story. There’s a fair bit of romance in the books but it doesn’t intrude on the story and helps the characters develop together in a fantastic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to spoil much so im going to end it here but I seriously suggest you give the series a try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 days ago. I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/&quot;&gt;reddit link&lt;/a&gt; leading to &amp;quot;Penguin Random House&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s list of 2021&amp;#39;s best books. I had just finished a few books and was looking for something good to pass my time. didn&amp;#39;t think I would come in contact with possibly one of my favorite books this year (I finished it in two days).&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, from the first chapter I recognized the same style as &amp;quot;The Martian&amp;quot; and kept wondering if it&amp;#39;s the same author:&lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t wanna spoil anything. Practically talking about any aspect of it spoils the experience, but to give you the general idea: &amp;quot;A man is in space&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s all you need and it&amp;#39;s all in the cover.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is incredible, also very easy to understand. the physics and math is well explained for people who forgot that kind of stuff, and practically a walk in the park for people who retained their highschool-level science education.&lt;br/&gt;
Character building is sublime and you&amp;#39;ll feel tethered to the main Character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes; My voice sparked amidst a paragraph and scared me because I was so invested in the story. My mind used most of it&amp;#39;s power to build the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t talk much about it. But if you&amp;#39;re looking for a good experience. I dearly recommend this book as it ignited my passion for science and more importantly, for &amp;quot;hard science-fiction&amp;quot;. One thing I learned, The best science fiction books are the ones set in your own time-line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait what else will come from my newest favorite author.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Author: Thank you, you&amp;#39;ve made me a very happy person&lt;/p&gt;

It might just be the best story ever told. Never before has a book gripped me this much. It contains all these devious, entertaining, bloodthirsty and incomprehensible and unpredictable characters who drive the conspiracy and blood laced plot that&amp;#39;s over too soon, despite being a full 1150 pages long and covering over a year. &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;The only problem I had was that the book doesn&amp;#39;t really have a climax. It has mini climaxes and scenes of hair raising tension but no ultimate climax. The resolution is in one page and the final chapter is just a monologue of things &lt;em&gt;that could happen&lt;/em&gt;.Considering the book is already this long,&lt;/span&gt; it&amp;#39;s understandable but I wish Clavell wrote a direct sequel, for the book is a great example of how incredible storytelling can overcome the lack of beautiful prose and a lot of plot and how for a novel to be entertaining, the art of storytelling is the key. The japanese short story writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa had a literary feud in the early 1920s with his contemporary Junichiro Tanizaki over whether story was more important than the way the story was told. Akutagawa held the latter position and I think he was right, after reading this book.10/10 from me.&lt;/p&gt;

I  read it as a teenager and even at that time I considered the author&amp;#39;s arguments to be weak and his conclusions far-fetched. However, it turns out that at that time I was a serious catholic boy who never questioned the standard interpretation of the Bible. That book was the first time I saw someone showing a different &amp;quot;historical&amp;quot; view of the OT. It was actually the first step that led me to actually read the Bible in a critical way, and later to my current atheism (that&amp;#39;s a plus, in my opinion). In addition, I was interested in science and it happens that the book had an equation! The relativistic formula for time dilation.

It really shows the internal struggles that Patroclus goes through near the ending of the story, culminating in the bittersweet ending of Patroclus pouring his heart out, reminiscing on his own memories of Achilles to Thetis, which shows the love and bond that the two had.

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve only read one Sci fi book and it was tiny: Time Machine, by HG Wells, which I really enjoyed. I think I might want to get into Sci-fi, but I don&amp;#39;t know if Dune is a good start. I have no particular problem with long books though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I go for it?!&lt;/p&gt;
